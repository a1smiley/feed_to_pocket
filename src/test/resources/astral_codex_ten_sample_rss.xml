Most of you already know the history behind this, but for anyone referred here by NYT, this is where I give my side and defend myself. </p><p>Like many people in the early 2000s, I started a blog when I was in college. To stay anonymous, I wrote it under my first and middle names &#8211; Scott Alexander &#8211; while leaving out my last name. I continued writing in it through medical school, residency, and until the present. Although I&#8217;ve never personally been involved in the tech industry, my blog became very popular among people in tech because it discussed ideas centering around scientific and technological progress, especially artificial intelligence.</p><p>In early 2020, I learned the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;wanted to write an article about me. They had discovered my real name and wanted to reveal it to the world. Their original pitch &#8211; and I don&#8217;t know if it was true or not &#8211; was that they were interested in how I warned about the coronavirus pandemic <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-links-speculation-open-thread/">very early</a> and urged people to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/23/face-masks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">wear face masks</a> before this was standard advice.</p><p>I was grateful for the interest, but still objected that I didn&#8217;t want my real name revealed to everyone. I think patients having too personal a relationship with their psychiatrist interferes with care. Patients being able to read my daily thoughts about everything &#8211; including medicine and psychiatry &#8211; would inevitably cause this sort of inappropriately personal relationship. This is the standard consensus in the psychiatric profession &#8211; see&nbsp;<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:rcPcxd0-nqQJ:https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/why-psychiatrists-don-t-share-personal-information-with-patients/">this Scientific American article</a>&nbsp;for more information, and it was the advice I received from various past mentors and other psychiatrists I consulted about this. The article also made me concerned for my safety, since there are some scary stories about Internet-famous people whose identities get revealed getting stalked or attacked or something.</p><p>When I discussed this with the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>, they said they were going to reveal my real name anyway. As a protest and an attempt to prevent this from happening, I deleted my blog and replaced it with <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/22/nyt-is-threatening-my-safety-by-revealing-my-real-name-so-i-am-deleting-the-blog/">a post condemning</a> the&nbsp;<em>New York Times&#8217;</em>&nbsp;actions. The post &#8220;went viral&#8221;, 513,000 people read it, hundreds (thousands?) of people cancelled their New York Times subscriptions in protest, and it was a major scandal. There were some news stories about it at the time &#8211; you can read some of them eg <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/slate-star-codex-and-silicon-valleys-war-against-the-media">here</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/i-failed-terribly-at-keeping-my-identity-secret-scott-alexander-on-the-value-of-pseudonymity">here</a>. I was proud to receive support from voices like Harvard professor Steven Pinker, Wikipedia founder Larry Sanger, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, science broadcaster Liv Boeree, and&nbsp;<em>Atlantic</em>&nbsp;editor Yascha Mounk.</p><p>The&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;backed off briefly as I stopped publishing, but I was also warned by people &#8220;in the know&#8221; that as soon as they got an excuse they would publish something as negative as possible about me, in order to punish me for embarrassing them. I didn&#8217;t want to spend the rest of my life in hiding, so I took various steps to make this more survivable, including quitting my previous job so my employers and coworkers would not get embroiled in my problems, and taking some steps to improve my personal safety. After doing all these things, I <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/still-alive">started blogging again</a>, this time under my real name so that I would not be under the constant threat of doxxing in the future. Predictably, the NYT piece came out soon after, and predictably, it was very negative. I want to respond to four main negative claims in the article &#8211; there are more, but these should give a general sketch of why I feel it was unfair:</p><p>1. The article tries to connect me to Charles Murray and <em>The Bell Curve, </em>saying:</p><blockquote><p>In one post, he <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/23/three-great-articles-on-poverty-and-why-i-disagree-with-all-of-them/">aligned himself with Charles Murray</a>, who proposed a link between race and IQ in  &#8220;The Bell Curve.&#8221; In another, he pointed out that Murray believes Black people &#8220;are genetically less intelligent than white people.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This is true only insofar as I once expressed agreement with an unrelated position of Charles Murray&#8217;s, where he thinks that telling poor people &#8220;learn to code&#8221; is not a compassionate or sufficient response for dealing with poverty, and that we need to act more decisively by providing poor people with a stable income. You can read the full post involved by following the link, but the paragraph that mentions Murray is:</p><blockquote><p>The only public figure I can think of in the southeast quadrant with me is Charles Murray. Neither he nor I would dare reduce all class differences to heredity, and he in particular has some very  sophisticated theories about class and culture. But he shares my  skepticism that the 55 year old Kentucky trucker can be taught to code,  and I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s too sanguine about the trucker&#8217;s kids either. His solution is a basic income guarantee, and I guess that&#8217;s mine too.</p></blockquote><p>The Times points out that I agreed with Murray that poverty was bad, and that also at some other point in my life noted that Murray had offensive views on race, and heavily implies this means I agree with Murray&#8217;s offensive views on race. This seems like a weirdly brazen type of falsehood for a major newspaper.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> In their litany of reasons I am bad, the <em>Times</em> says I compared some feminists to Voldemort. Their exact words are:</p><blockquote><p>He described <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/31/radicalizing-the-romanceless/" title="">some feminists as something close to Voldemort</a>, the embodiment of evil in the Harry Potter books.  </p></blockquote><p>This is true only in the sense that in 2014, I applied this comparison to a specific group of feminists who I accused of bullying and taunting people in a way that made them traumatized and suicidal. I describe my specific concern in the linked post. Lots of other feminists are great, and I continue to support gender equality.</p><p>Also, this became a weird go-to thing for people who wanted to do hatchet jobs to hit me with, so much so that sometime before 2017 I edited the post involved telling people not to do that. I can&#8217;t remember exactly when this happened, but here&#8217;s <a href="https://archive.is/1kSM7">the 2017 archive.is version</a> showing the change already existed then. For at least the past three years, the paragraph in question has looked like this:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-249-683" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F886e41a4-cc22-4a9b-96b0-11fbf6ff4c93_683x249.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F886e41a4-cc22-4a9b-96b0-11fbf6ff4c93_683x249.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/886e41a4-cc22-4a9b-96b0-11fbf6ff4c93_683x249.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:249,&quot;width&quot;:683,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:11509,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

I have 1,557 other posts worth of material he could have used, and the sentence he chose to go with was the one that was crossed out and included a plea for people to stop taking it out of context.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> The <em>Times</em> also presented a more general case that I was a bad ally to women in tech. I deny this claim. I have repeatedly blogged about studies suggesting that women are underrepresented in tech not because of explicit discrimination on the part of tech companies, but because women lose interest in tech very early, at least by high school (high school computer science classes are <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/infographic/3435">something like 80% male</a>, the same as big tech companies). The post that most effectively sums up my thoughts on this topic is <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/07/contra-grant-on-exaggerated-differences/">Contra Grant On Exaggerated Differences</a>. I continue to believe these studies are true, I&#8217;ve spoken with some of the researchers who have performed them, and the New York Times itself has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/science/15tier.html">previously written about and praised</a> these same studies. I think understanding the reasons behind gender imbalances in tech is vital towards figuring out how to address them better than we&#8217;re addressing them now. There is no evidence that women are inherently any less intelligent or any worse at math than men, and I have tried to make this very clear in all of my posts on the subject - for example in the Contra Grant post linked above, where I say, quote, &#8220;My research suggests no average gender difference in ability&#8221;.</p><p>4. They further presented a more general case that I am six-degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon-style linked to right-wing / pro-Trump figures in Silicon Valley like Peter Thiel. This is true &#8211; I can think of a friend of mine who also knows Peter Thiel. In fact, I met Peter Thiel once, kind of unexpectedly, at a party, long before Trump was in the news, and exchanged about two sentences of conversation with him (I don&#8217;t think he had the slightest idea who I was, nor was there any reason he should have). I have never personally met the other right-wing figures named in the article. I wrote <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/">a 30,000 word condemnation</a> of one of them on my blog a few years ago, and we have since had some email exchanges about to what degree this was unfair. I received a sympathetic email from another of them about the&nbsp;<em>Times</em>&nbsp;article. Others I have had literally no contact with. Again, it <a href="https://www.theonion.com/kevin-bacon-linked-to-al-qaeda-1819566633">would not surprise me if</a> I was a few degrees of social separation from some of these people. I don&#8217;t feel like this means I have done anything wrong, and I assume most people are a few degrees of social separation away from a Republican or Trump supporter. I myself am a Democrat, voted Warren (IIRC) in the primary, and Biden in the general.</p><p>Many of the points in the article besides these four are equally flawed, but I hope this is enough to establish the general pattern.</p><p>I don&#8217;t want to accuse the New York Times of <em>lying </em>about me, exactly, but if they were truthful, it was in the same way as that famous movie review which describes the Wizard of Oz as: &#8220;Transported to a surreal landscape, a young girl kills the first person she meets and then teams up with three strangers to kill again.&#8221; </p><p>I believe they misrepresented me as retaliation for my publicly objecting to their policy of doxxing bloggers in a way that threatens their livelihood and safety. Because they are much more powerful than I am and have a much wider reach, far more people will read their article than will read my response, so probably their plan will work.</p><p>I&#8217;ve already done what everybody with a bone to pick against the media has - moved to Substack and made a lot of money. But I&#8217;m heartbroken about the collateral damage that the article will inflict on my friends, my family, my (probably extremely confused right now) patients, the communities I&#8217;m part of, and the causes I care about. However much I deserve this, they all deserve it much less. I&#8217;m deeply sorry to all of them for the part I probably played in giving them what will probably be a difficult and awkward few weeks. </p><p>Please do not contact me about the New York Times situation unless you have a very specific and important request. For the sake of my own peace of mind, I am hoping to stop thinking about it the moment I hit &#8220;publish&#8221; on this post. Your not contacting me about it will help me in this process. I appreciate your support.</p><p>I am writing this as a necessary ritual to avoid silence being taken as evidence of guilt. I have no particular call for action. Please don&#8217;t cause any trouble for the journalist involved, both because that would be wrong, and because I suspect he did not personally want to write this and was pressured into it as part of the Times&#8217; retaliatory measures against me.</p><p>I will probably miss tomorrow&#8217;s Open Thread in the interests of keeping this on the top of the blog. Normal posting will resume on Monday.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Precision Of Sensory Evidence]]></title><description><![CDATA[P(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.]]></description><link>https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-precision-of-sensory-evidence</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-precision-of-sensory-evidence</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Alexander]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 00:06:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b7f06eee-1cdb-4520-ae33-d5a8c0baa6c5_800x533.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[<em>semi-necessary prerequisites: </em><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/">Surfing Uncertainty</a>, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/08/ssc-journal-club-friston-on-computational-mood/">Friston On Computational Mood</a>]</p><p>In earlier posts, I've expressed confusion about two competing models of depression. In one - supported by an analogy to mania and various forms of sensory and motor disturbance - it's <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/12/toward-a-predictive-theory-of-depression/">inappropriately low neural confidence levels</a>. In the other - supported by common sense - it's <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/08/ssc-journal-club-friston-on-computational-mood/">a highly-confident global prior on negative perceptions and events</a> - a bias to interpret incoming information in a threat-related way. Both of these models had a lot going for them. But they didn't really fit together. Van der Bergh et al&#8217;s <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cristina_Ottaviani/publication/341577413_Better_safe_than_sorry_A_common_signature_of_general_vulnerability_for_psychopathology/links/5ec8be8192851c11a8816da0/Better-safe-than-sorry-A-common-signature-of-general-vulnerability-for-psychopathology.pdf">Better Safe Than Sorry: A Common Signature Of General Vulnerability For Psychopathology</a>, in the October issue of <em>Perspectives In Psychological Science,</em> tries to tie the pieces together into a more ambitious theory of negative emotionality, including depression, anxiety and trauma.</p><p>Its solution is that these conditions are marked by a processing style that assigns unusually low precision to sensory evidence. All perception and cognition is the combination of evidence and priors. But in depression and otherwise neurotic people, the evidence is only a weak signal and the priors are a much stronger one.</p><p>Before we get into their argument, a clarification on sensory evidence - yes, this includes normal senses like vision and hearing. But it's also your "internal" senses, like your ability to vividly experience memories. Or your ability to detect and interpret your own emotions. Maybe even an inferential sense, as in when you "sense" that somebody is angry at you by reasoning from their actions. In VDBEA's "negative emotional" people, all of these senses are "low precision" - your brain artificially down-weights their signal, marks them as suspicious and untrustworthy.</p><p>This model where negative emotionality reduces sensory precision is supported by lots of oddities we've already talked about so far. Like:</p><p>- When depressed people say the world looks gray, they're <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/12/toward-a-predictive-theory-of-depression/">being literal</a>; visual tests show that their color perception is genuinely dulled. Likewise, recovering depressives say the world seems bright and colorful again, and manic people say the world seems oversaturated, even brighter and more colorful than usual. The association between bright colors and happiness is found across cultures.</p><p>- The more depressed you are, the worse your sense of smell, as measured by something called (sigh) <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/17/depression-the-olfactory-perspective/">the Sniffin' Sticks Test</a>.</p><p>- In <em><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/12/book-review-the-body-keeps-the-score/">The Body Keeps The Score</a></em>, Bessel van der Kolk writes about the deep link between trauma and poor bodily awareness. For example, trauma patients do much worse than normal on tests of stereoagnosia, where you have to identify an object (eg a key) by touch alone. He gives the example of a trauma patient undergoing massage therapy who was so out-of-touch with his body that he didn't even notice the massage had started. Trauma patients tend to say they "can't feel their bodies" or "they're living in a fog"; on successful treatment, they say they "feel alive again" or "I'm back in my body".</p><p>- Autobiographical memory is impaired in depression and trauma. This is obvious when eg people can't remember traumatic events at all, or have holes in their memory. But a vast literature shows that depressed and traumatized people have worse autobiographical memory in general. When asked to remember an emotionally neutral event, they <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17100527/">will be less specific than a healthy person</a>; this doesn't seem linked to general decline in memory.</p><p>Since sensory evidence gets lower weight, the brain is more likely to defer to its prior, which in traumatized/depressed people includes a global expectation that things will be bad.</p><p>VDBEA point out that this is a self-reinforcing cycle. Suppose you expect everything to be bad. You go on a date. The date goes fine. But you can only assess how it went using your brain - and that means combining the evidence and a prior. But you downweight the evidence and defer to the prior. That means that unless the date went amazing, you probably conclude that the date went badly. And since you think the date went badly, now you have additional new information supporting your prior that things are always bad. End result: even though your date went fine, you become more certain of your theory that everything is always bad. Your depression deepens.</p><p>(I was a little bit resistant to this part. Suppose we rank the goodness of events on a scale from -10 to 10. In reality they average 0, ie completely neutral. You're depressed, so you have a prior that they'll average -9, ie quite bad indeed. And you assess things based 66% on your prior, 33% on evidence. You go on an average date, ie 0. Given your prior of -9 and your weighting, you perceive it as having a valence of -6. You expected things to be -9 bad, but they were really only -6 bad; it seems you were overly pessimistic. You update your prior some bit of the way between -9 and -6. Do this enough times, and you should be able to get your prior all the way back to 0, ie eliminate your depression. Right? The people I asked about this didn't think it would work - it can't possibly be this simple, maybe "bad" and "not bad" are binary states and once your brain decides something is bad it fails to process that it was slightly less bad than expected. Or maybe it <em>is</em> this simple - most cases of depression eventually resolve. I don't know. But it's easy to see that the more heavily you weight your prior compared to sensory evidence, the harder and longer the resolution process will take.)</p><p>The way this might feel to you is - you go on the date. Your date looks bored (because your priors make you hypersensitive to cues that they are bored) and the food tastes subpar (because that's how you're expecting the food to taste, and your priors are stronger than whatever stream of real sensation is making it through your taste buds - it can happen <a href="https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/08/the_most_infamous_study_on_wine_tasting.html">to the best of us</a>). Looking over the date after you get home, you hyperfocus on the one really embarrassing thing you said, and any good parts of it mysteriously slip your mind. You conclude that the date went terribly, that you're a useless person who can't do anything right, that the world has it out for you, and you were dumb to think you could ever succeed at dating. Now you're primed to be even more miserable next time around.</p><p>But the same thing can happen when recalling and reconsolidating memories. VDBEA link this to trauma processing. Usually when something scary happens, you gradually "process" it in a way related to the normal habituation response. That is, the first time you bungee jump you're probably pretty scared. But you bungee jump a few times, nothing bad happens to you, you learn on a preconscious level that it's not dangerous, and then you're fine with it. In theory you should be able to do the same with traumatic memories: you think about the traumatic event, but since the trauma's over and thoughts alone can't harm you, you're fine and you habituate to the trauma and don't mind thinking about it anymore. In practice - in real PTSD - that's not how it works. VDBEA think it's because the sensory channel is underweighted compared to the priors channel. You think about your trauma (using reconstructed memory perceived through the sensory channel), and that's however bad it is, but you also have your strong prior that this is terrible and thinking about it is horrifying and awful, so the system that should be habituating to the trauma is actually "learning" to become more and more afraid of it.</p><p>I've been kind of imprecise here, lumping together depression and trauma and causes and effects and so on. The more rigorous version is that the tendency to underweight sensory evidence (and correspondingly overweight priors) is what VDBEA call a "better safe than sorry" processing strategy. In threat-detection, avoiding false negatives is more important than avoiding false positives - if you mistake a tree stump for a tiger it's mildly embarrassing, but if you mistake a tiger for a tree stump, you're dead. So in a threat-laden environment, you want to both adjust your prior to be that things are threats, <em>and</em> over-weight your prior relative to sensory evidence. Some people could have this processing strategy because they're genetically programmed to have it, and these people will be more vulnerable to depression, and more likely to get PTSD for any given level of trauma. Other people will get traumatized into it - something will happen that ups their estimate of how threat-laden the environment is and makes this cognitive strategy more attractive. </p><p>If this is true, what does it imply about treating conditions of negative emotionality?</p><p>First, it justifies various psychotherapies - EMDR and <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/26/mental-mountains/">coherence therapy</a> seem to come out especially well here - that focus on trying to get the brain to pay unusually precise attention, under unusually safe conditions, to something it usually represses. If dysfunctional negative emotions come from a situation where the attention you're able to focus on a negative belief/memory is so low-precision that you can't override your prior that it's terrible, you need to find a way to focus high-precision attention on it and hold it there even though that will start out being hard and aversive. Trauma-focused therapies seem particularly designed to do that - and maybe something about the eye movements in EMDR specifically increases the available precision of your attention?</p><p>Second, it justifies some of Dr. van der Kolk's writing on <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/12/book-review-the-body-keeps-the-score/">somatic therapies</a>. Bodily sensation seems to be an unusually important form of sensory evidence. Anything that gets you more "in your body", convinces you to pay attention to your body, trains you to expect bodily sensation to be pleasant rather than aversive, or helps you interact with your body more precisely should increase the precision of sensory evidence in general. So massage, yoga, tai chi, etc. </p><p>Third, what if you tried to cut out the middleman, and just focus really really hard on your sensory channel, trying to experience awareness in as much precision as possible? This seemed like an interesting enough lifehack that I tried it for a few minutes before realizing I had accidentally just reinvented meditation. Darn. But meditation is still pretty good and it's nice to have an idea of one of the ways it might work. Meditators talk about a stage of meditation where they feel that their traumas and preconditioning just dissolve under the light of increased awareness, and the idea of increasing precision of sensory evidence might explain what this means.</p><p>Fourth, what do we know about all of this pharmacologically? Priors seem to be <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/12/its-bayes-all-the-way-up/">encoded in NMDA receptors</a> and their relative strength modulated by <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/10/ssc-journal-club-relaxed-beliefs-under-psychedelics-and-the-anarchic-brain/">5-HT2A receptors</a>, so if you wanted to downweight priors (and so relatively upweight sensory evidence), you would want NDMA antagonists or 5-HT2A agonists. That would mean ketamine and psychedelics, which is a good match for ketamine-assisted and psychedelic-assisted therapies where you take the relevant drug, then explore a trauma or memory that you're "stuck" on, then find that your explorations have "unstuck" you much more than they would have without the drug. Sensory evidence seems to be something something AMPA receptors, so maybe ampakines would also be helpful here, but I don't know of any sufficiently good ones, except maybe ketamine again.</p><p>So this model, where inappropriately narrow sensory evidence channels create a bottleneck that makes it impossible to process sufficiently traumatic memories, ties a lot of things together. It gives me the understanding of the trauma-somatization link that <em>The Body Keeps The Score</em> never quite managed. It helps tie together the mechanisms of action for psychedelics, meditation, and therapy. And it resolves the apparent dichotomy between depression as low confidence and depression as negative prior that's been bothering me for so long. This is the most exciting paper I've read so far this year and an important addition to my understanding of predictive processing and psychiatry in general.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[List Of Fictional Cryptocurrencies Banned By The SEC]]></title><description><![CDATA[I said they were fictional!

The state auctions its tokens to the highest bidder, presumably a bridge-building company. If the company builds the bridge, their tokens are worth $1 billion and they probably make a nice profit; if not, they might resell the tokens (at a heavily discounted price) to some other bridge-building company.

Epistemic status: <strong>speculative</strong>. This should go without saying, but when I talk about &#8220;failures&#8221; in this post, I mean failures of biological processes, as in the term &#8220;congestive heart failure&#8221;; I don&#8217;t mean to accuse people with psychiatric conditions of being failures.]</em></p><p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>Most psychiatric disorders are at least partly genetic. Some, like schizophrenia and ADHD, are very genetic, probably 80% plus. This is strange, because having psychiatric disorders seems bad, so you would expect evolution to have eliminated those genes. Researchers looking into this question argue between two hypotheses. </p><p>First, a <em>failure</em>. Evolution is imperfect, so some bad genes manage to slip through. This sounds dismissive, but it's definitely true to some degree. Thousands of different genes contribute to risk for conditions like ADHD and schizophrenia, with each adding only a tiny amount of risk. When a gene is only very slightly bad, it takes evolution millennia to get rid of it, and during those millennia people are getting new very-slightly-bad mutations, so it all balances out at a certain level of bad genes per generation. Those bad genes are sufficient to explain the existing amount of ADHD and schizophrenia; they're just evolution not working as well as we'd hope.</p><p>Second, a <em>tradeoff </em>between two goods. The genes for psychiatric disorders are good in some way. Maybe having some schizophrenia genes (maybe not enough to give you schizophrenia) makes you more creative and raises your inclusive fitness. This keeps schizophrenia risk genes in the population, and sometimes two people with very high level of these genes will mate and their child will have schizophrenia. "Higher creativity" vs. "lower schizophrenia risk" is a tradeoff, and different people are at different points on the tradeoff, and some people will be so far to one end that they will get schizophrenia.</p><p>Recent research has pretty heavily favored the failure hypothesis. If you have enough people's genomes, you can use some complicated math to infer how evolution is affecting different genes. And on most of the schizophrenia risk genes we know about, evolution has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502987/">gradually eliminating them</a> in a way that looks like they're on net harmful - not keeping them around in a way that looks like they have counterbalancing advantages. In the modern day, people with genes for psychiatric disorders tend to have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15833">fewer, rather than more</a> children than people without those genes - except in the case of ADHD, which I'm tempted to cynically attribute to them being less likely to remember to use contraception.</p><p>Also, a lot of the theories about how psychiatric disorder genes are good suggest that different disorders are good in opposite ways. For example, schizophrenia genes are supposed to give you more artistic creativity, whereas autism genes are supposed to make you more cool-headed and rational. This makes a kind of intuitive sense looking at the symptoms of the disorders. But it turns out that many, <em>many</em> of the genes that cause autism also cause schizophrenia, and vice versa. They seem to be general genes for having mental disorders, with a wide variety of negative effects - which seems like a better match for the first theory where they're just plain bad news and evolution hasn't gotten around to eliminating them yet.</p><p>Also, things that we <em>know</em> are failures are known risk factors for psychiatric disorders. For example, if your mother got a serious infection when she was pregnant with you, your risk of autism <a href="https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/home/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders/maternal-infection-in-pregnancy-increases-risk-for-autism-depression-in-offspring/">goes up 70%</a>. In fact, just being conceived in March <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3296777/">raises your autism risk a bit</a> - it means you were in an especially vulnerable developmental stage duriing flu season! Prenatal or perinatal pesticide exposure <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20190321/another-study-links-pesticide-exposure-autism">probably increases autism risk</a>. If you couldn't breathe for a while after birth - either something went wrong during the birth process or your lungs just took a while to come online - that doubles your risk (see exact numbers for that and sixty other prenatal and perinatal factors <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3387855/">here</a>). None of these things are good or have any counterbalancing advantages. They're all just failures of the normal developmental process that can be expected to make you worse off.</p><p>So the failure hypothesis is definitely the way that the evidential winds are blowing. </p><p>Still, I can't help feeling like some tradeoffs <em>have to</em> be involved. Some of the research findings that make me think this:</p><p>Many large studies (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201512?fbclid=IwAR2mp3BHTcK6JMZdifY62vC2epbPpeKcAoFjVd5Au4TrtIUmQmMTQuZHJbI">1</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2015225">2</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6454898/">3</a>, etc) show a strong correlation at the genetic level between autism risk and intelligence (especially mathematical intelligence), suggesting that the more autism genes you have, the smarter you are (although actually autistic people tend to have lower measured IQs than neurotypicals). Other studies (<a href="http://www.philipcorr.net/uploads/downloads/48.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/30661096/the-relationship-between-measures-creativity-and-schizotypy.pdf?1361908427=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DThe_relationship_between_measures_of_cre.pdf&amp;Expires=1596005434&amp;Signature=VgUC2Bq8CPXiwA~5O0oSFZ~DptKrsSvSjjWmYSApH3EqdOp2mG7jHIlmlc4g2L8ToM5lVm6jseb16g5YJo4wY-lKaO42swN8Srm4Muol8nlPMnNeMwijhOvF6v4DkLDKZj9usS2JqUfDm479ww1rApLLcGBqkKoxzW9fg1sVPImU8A-lRKlZVGkCnvotMMyrA1bBQBczad9t4RDY9aZ~n9Hdk3U6~me9rXsxsltrhRpRmv~wURWzImQfDHaklDoHn-xIGK3g0lG7SvD5eGWnF~Obhwiac~Tycu7jnGAlVFttbNpvXWiaekEZ9wJ-arMvTr54ihpv1TfpOWRT6zanhw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA">2</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1560060/">3</a>, etc) find an association between schizophrenia and creativity (especially artistic creativity) - see eg the story about James Joyce <a href="https://johnsapiro.com/2015/06/30/you-are-swimming-in-it-your-daughter-is-drowning/">swimming vs. drowning</a>. Still other studies (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4691282/">1</a>, <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1002/1097-4679(198905)45:3%3C433::aid-jclp2270450313%3E3.0.co;2-x">2</a>, etc) show that anorexia is associated with higher achievement in school. The effect remains even when controlled for IQ, suggesting it probably involves perfectionism and being willing to go to extremes in order to achieve socially valued outcomes - in the same way as, well, anorexia. </p><p>Also, a very few disorders do seem to be genetically opposite each other.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/dr_appie/status/1309071771082031104&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Check out this wonderful application &amp;amp; extension of Genomic SEM, used to identify and analyze the genetic architecture of 4 factors underlying 11 major psychiatric disorders: Neurodevelopmental, Compulsive, Psychotic, &amp;amp; Internalizing Disorders. \n\nPreprint: <a class=\&quot;tweet-url\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.20196089v1\&quot;>medrxiv.org/content/10.110&#8230;</a> &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;dr_appie&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Abdel Abdellaoui&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Thu Sep 24 10:06:46 +0000 2020&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/EirAku_XsAI9fLp.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/NeBVBMF5oI&quot;}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:20,&quot;like_count&quot;:71,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{}}"><a href="https://twitter.com/dr_appie/status/1309071771082031104" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/dr_appie.jpg"><span class="tweet-author-name">Abdel Abdellaoui </span><span class="tweet-author">@dr_appie</span></div>Check out this wonderful application &amp; extension of Genomic SEM, used to identify and analyze the genetic architecture of 4 factors underlying 11 major psychiatric disorders: Neurodevelopmental, Compulsive, Psychotic, &amp; Internalizing Disorders.

It also supports a common-sense idea that there's a spectrum from much-too-careful to much-too-carefree whose extremes are ADHD and OCD, but which might have other advantages - being either careful or carefree can be helpful in certain situations.</p><p>And even beyond the studies - I used to work in the business district of San Francisco, meaning I got to see a lot of very high-functioning people with mental disorders. I was constantly surprised how many people - while genuinely suffering from their conditions - also seem to be succeeding partly because of them. The bipolar programmer who is nonfunctional half the year, but his company keeps him on anyway because he codes at an absolutely superhuman level of brilliance while manic. The obsessive-compulsive cybersecurity expert who finds weaknesses everybody else missed. The endless line of autistic people succeeding in math-heavy jobs, exactly the way the stereotypes would predict.</p><p>When I was in medical school, <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/61/9d/c7/619dc76fa50b15c39a555536616d9c09.jpg">the joke</a> (not really a joke) was that everyone with ADHD went into emergency medicine. I've since treated a couple of doctors with ADHD, and sure enough they are all in emergency medicine. But now I'm in the Bay Area, and the joke is that everyone with ADHD founds a startup. This has made its way into lots of business advice columns (<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/327795">1</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dalearcher/2014/05/14/adhd-the-entrepreneurs-superpower/#61e181359e97">2</a>, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/286808">3</a>, etc), and is also confirmed by my personal experience - though I should also mention just how disproportionately people with ADHD become salespeople. My impression - and I could give you a couple of studies that vaguely back it up, but they'd all be sort of hokey - is that people with ADHD are worse at dealing with low levels of stimulation and situations requiring careful focus, but sometimes <em>better</em> at dealing with high levels of stimulation and situations requiring frantic task switching.</p><p>(if it weren't for medical confidentiality laws, I think I could make a fortune running a combination psychiatric clinic / employment agency. As soon as I diagnosed someone with ADHD, I would sell their contact information to recruiters from sales companies, the local ER, and Y Combinator. Autistics, big tech companies. Obsessives, anyone in security. Schizotypals, the nearest art school. Psychopaths, local government. It'd be great!)</p><p>This is all fun to think about, but again, the research is pretty discouraging. It shows that most genes for psychiatric disorders are clearly negative. It also shows that most psychiatric disorders decrease functioning, including the form of functioning one might expect them to help. People with autism have low IQ, people with schizophrenia have low creativity (at least on some ways of operationalizing creativity), people with ADHD have low IQ and generally worse outcomes in every domain. So the current scientific consensus is that no, it's definitely failures.</p><p>I think the best way to reconcile this is to say it's sometimes failures and sometimes tradeoffs, with the failures sufficiently more common that studies that naively just sum everything up (eg check whether the overall genetic correlation is positive or negative, or whether average IQ is higher or lower) mostly find a failure. Let's discuss in more detail what this might look like.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Suppose you hear of a nearby country where guilty criminals often walk free. There are just as many police officers as in your own country, they make just as many arrests, but when the trials are over, you hear a lot of stories about guilty people getting acquitted. You might consider two different hypotheses about why this happens.</p><p>One, the justice system in that country is terrible and cannot distinguish innocent from guilty people. Detectives constantly screw up, juries make bad decisions, judges are idiots.</p><p>Two, that country is deeply committed to the idea that no innocent person should ever go to jail. They carefully instruct juries not to convict unless the evidence really is "beyond a reasonable doubt", and are willing to accept that this means a lot of people who realistically probably broke the law won't get punished. Maybe they demand multiple witnesses before conviction, or lots of material evidence.</p><p>In first hypothesis, the problem comes from a failure. The justice system just sucks; if they could make it better they would, but they can't.</p><p>In the second hypothesis, the problem comes from a tradeoff. You can trade off "number of guilty people who correctly get punished" vs. "number of innocent people who correctly go free" by varying your evidential threshold for guilt higher or lower. This country chose to make it higher They get some good things out of this (fewer innocent people wrongly get punished) and some bad things out of this (fewer guilty people correctly get punished). Overall there is less wrongful imprisonment, but it's harder to catch criminals. This happens to be their choice on the tradeoff space; it would be a value judgment to call it better or worse than your own.</p><p>But in reality, failures and tradeoffs will interact. In a country biased towards finding people innocent, it only takes a tiny failure to let a murderer go free. In a country biased towards finding people guilty, it would take a huge failure, or many different failures in parallel. If a particular murderer goes free, we can always blame both the country's position both on the tradeoff (because if it had been less biased towards finding innocence than it was, the problem might not have happened) and the country's level of failure (because if detectives, juries, etc were more competent, they might have been able to meet even a very high burden of proof).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-551-673" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61743c6b-5f33-4264-a722-cfb527351950_673x551.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61743c6b-5f33-4264-a722-cfb527351950_673x551.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/61743c6b-5f33-4264-a722-cfb527351950_673x551.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:551,&quot;width&quot;:673,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:19567,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

If the US falsely believes that Russia has launched nuclear missiles, they will "retaliate" with real nuclear missiles, starting a nuclear war. There are two sets of risk factors for such a false alarm. First, the US radar has to fail catastrophically, reporting a missile launch when no such launch has happened. Second, the US has to decide to respond to an apparent missile launch by immediate retaliation, rather than a "wait and see" approach.</p><p>The first risk factor is a failure. The missile system was poorly built, stupid, buggy, defective. There is no advantage to having a missile system like this. It just means you were too dumb to make a better one.</p><p>The second risk factor is a tradeoff. The slower you are to retaliate, the less likely you are to respond to false alarms - but also, the less likely you are to respond to real alarms in time. This is why the military has their DEFCON system. DEFCON5 (total safety) means the military doesn't see any immediate threat and apparent anomalies can be investigated at leisure. DEFCON1 means nuclear war is imminent and everyone should be on hair trigger alert. Being on DEFCON 1 vs. DEFCON 5 is a tradeoff. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>If a false alarm starts a nuclear war, it will probably be because of a failure plus a tradeoff: a failure to have decent radar, plus a potentially reasonable decision to be at high alert. The stronger the tradeoff, the less of a failure you need to produce disaster, and vice versa. If the military was on DEFCON 5 (low alert), then it might have taken a phenomenal level of failure to make the commander launch the missile; maybe every radar system in the country would have had to fail simultaneously over a long period. On the other hand, if the military was on DEFCON 1 where they were expecting an enemy launch any second and the commander's finger was hovering over the launch button, maybe just someone sneezing would have set off the hair-trigger and caused the launch. You can have have a disaster from failure-with-no-tradeoff or from tradeoff-with-no-failure - but it's a lot easier when you have both at once.</p><p>I think this is how autoimmune diseases work, more or less. The immune system can be either more or less active. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2099313-autoimmune-diseases-may-be-side-effect-of-a-strong-immune-system/">This is a tradeoff</a>: the more active it is, the better it is at dealing with infection, but the more likely it is to accidentally attack the body and cause autoimmune symptoms. And then the immune system can either fail or not fail. Some people have very active immune systems, but the systems are very good at what they do and only attack genuine pathogens. Other people have very weak immune systems, but the immune system is so confused that the one thing it can muster up the energy to attack is your own body. Like the accidental nuclear war, the autoimmune disease is the combined result of a tradeoff plus a failure.</p><p>And I think this is how anxiety disorders work too. People can be more or less anxious. Being anxious all the time is no fun. But having no anxiety at all isn't fun either; maybe you poke a lion with a stick to see what happens, and then your genes don't make it into the next generation. Having higher or lower baseline anxiety is a tradeoff, just like having your country's military on high alert vs. low alert. But if you also have a failure - your anxiety flares up at things that aren't really that bad, and doesn't go away - then you have an anxiety disorder.</p><p>Either end of the tradeoff is defensible. But either end of the tradeoff is vulnerable to failure. </p><p>If you have high anxiety (but no failures), then you're a very careful person and it probably works out well for you, unless you're absurdly careful. </p><p>If you have low anxiety (but no failures), then you're a very brave person and that probably works out well too, unless you're suicidally brave.</p><p>If you have high anxiety (and many failures), then you're probably naturally protected against failures of too-low anxiety, but especially vulnerable to failures of too-high anxiety, and you panic constantly over little things that don't matter.</p><p>If you have low anxiety (and many failures), then you're probably naturally protected against failures of too-high anxiety, but especially vulnerable to failures of too-low anxiety, and you poke lions with sticks for no reason.</p><p>So problems with anxiety - constant disproportionate flares of anxiety that serve no legitimate goal - are a combination of tradeoff and failure.</p><p>Let's look at a complicated more real-life example: autism.</p><p>As we discussed before, there are plenty of well-known environmental risk factors for autism. None of these things - having to fight off infections in the womb, exposure to toxic chemicals, brain damage from suffocation - have any upside. They are just plain bad. There is no reason they should make your brain any better in any way, and as far as we know they don't make your brain better in any way. They just damage delicate developmental processes. They are part of the failure bin, not part of the tradeoff bin.</p><p>A second cause of autism is "de novo mutations" - new mutations that begin with the autistic person themselves, rather than being transmitted to them from their parents. For example, a certain especially bad type of <em>de novo</em> mutation <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259766765_The_role_of_de_novo_mutations_in_the_genetics_of_autism_spectrum_disorders">was found</a> in 20% of autistic patients and only 10% of their siblings, suggesting it significantly contributes to autism. Almost all de novo mutations are bad, for the same reason that changing a random letter in a book almost never causes the book to be better, and almost always makes it worse. In case you don't believe this for some reason, scientists have checked and found that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/41/E5600">the mutations are negatively selected against</a>, meaning evolution agrees they are bad. It's unlikely that any of these mutations have positive tradeoffs. This is another failure.</p><p>Even normal autism risk genes that people get from their parents are mostly straight-out bad. At least this is how I interpret <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s10519-016-9804-4">Tsur, Friger, and Menashe</a> who find evidence of negative selection for most autism-related variants - based on their place in the genome, it looks like evolution has been trying hard to get rid of them. Also, some risk genes are shared with other psychiatric disorders, like <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0488-4">schizophrenia, bipolar</a>, <a href="https://www.healio.com/news/psychiatry/20191212/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-common-genetic-structure">ADHD, and Tourette's</a>. These disorders all have very different symptoms, and very different associated personalities, but they all have one thing in common: they are abnormal and dysfunctional. Most likely these genes are involved in basic brain functions - making sure cells get enough oxygen, keeping the blood-brain barrier strong, preventing inflammation - and less functional alleles generally make everything worse. These, too, are in our failure column.</p><p>And yet there are <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150310105232.htm">clear signs</a> that other autism risk genes are associated with intelligence, and some of these are even <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2017/02/27/genetic-risk-autism-spectrum-disorder-linked-evolutionary-brain-benefit">positively selected</a>. My guess is that these involve a tradeoff. I don't know exactly what this tradeoff is, but I tend to go with <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00302/full">Lawson, Rees, and Friston&#8217;s</a> speculation that autistic brains think with higher precision. This lets them think more precisely when that would be useful, but it also means they're constantly getting false negatives (ie not recognizing a person's face if the shadows on it are slightly different), constantly having their attention hijacked by minor stimuli that the rest of us would ignore (sensitivities to stimuli very slightly different from expected stimuli, like the dripping of water or the feeling of the tag on their shirt), and constantly getting confused by minimal deviations from routine. And although it's less obvious, some people have speculated that this makes it harder to do the sort of intuitive categorization work that lets you draw conclusions from social situations.</p><p>My guess is that somebody who's chosen the far end of this tradeoff naturally ends up as the stereotypical "aspie engineer", who's very smart, a bit off, but not so far gone he can't hold down his job at Google.</p><p>Add some failures to this tradeoff, and things get much worse. Your brain gives you false information, <em>and</em> you refuse to recognize anything as a match unless it's precisely the same. This is when you get the sort of autistic people who can't take care of themselves and need to be institutionalized their whole lives.</p><p>If, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/12/11/diametrical-model-of-autism-and-schizophrenia/">as Badcock and Crespi claim</a>, schizophrenia is the reverse of autism, it might involve being too imprecise - too willing to declare the identity of unlike data - too quick to pattern-match. If autistics are too quick to mistake signal for noise, schizophrenics are quick to mistake noise for signal. In a well-functioning brain, this makes them creative and socially adept; in a poorly-functioning brain that is constantly getting things wrong, they connect everything to everything else and it's a mess.</p><p>I don't know if this is quite right. But it would reconcile two seemingly contradictory sets of findings. First, Badcock and Crespi's claim that in many ways autism seems like the reverse of schizophrenia. Second, the genetics and epidemiology data showing that autism and schizophrenia share most of their genes and risk factors. The shared risk factors are <em>things that cause failure</em>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-551-673" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d3097d-8f2e-4bc1-b217-a81f987e43d9_673x551.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d3097d-8f2e-4bc1-b217-a81f987e43d9_673x551.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40d3097d-8f2e-4bc1-b217-a81f987e43d9_673x551.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:551,&quot;width&quot;:673,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:24528,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

If you ask which tradeoffs cause each problem, you'll find they're opposites. But if you ask which failures cause each problem, you'll find they're mostly the same - lazy jurors, stupid detectives, insufficient funding. I think this matches the psychiatric case, where disorders can seem opposite in many ways but also share many of the same risk factors.</p><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>I think most psychiatric disorders exist on a spectrum from mostly-tradeoff to mostly-failure (what we might call "high-functioning" and "low-functioning" versions of the same phenotype).</p><p>Mostly-tradeoff ADHD looks like someone who is adventurous, likes variety, and thrives in high-stress situations, but is also bad at tolerating boring situations.</p><p>Mostly-tradeoff schizophrenia (which might be schizotypal personality disorder, or a subset of it, I'm not sure) looks like someone who is creative, attuned to interesting patterns, and charismatic, but also a bit odd and superstitious.</p><p>Mostly-tradeoff OCD (which might be obsessive-compulsive personality disorder) looks like somebody who's responsible and perfectionist, but has trouble letting things go.</p><p>I think Cluster B personality disorders are already tradeoffs; adding failures just make them less effective ones. For example, tradeoff-antisocial-personality is a con man who uses unethical means to get ahead (and sometimes succeeds); tradeoff-plus-failure-antisocial usually ends up in prison very quickly and never gets out.</p><p>I don't think depression, bipolar, PTSD, or addiction fit this model neatly. Depression and bipolar are probably <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ontology-of-psychiatric-conditions-34e">attractor states in dynamical systems</a>; it's possible that having this attractor state has counterbalancing advantages, but I couldn't begin to speculate on what they are. PTSD and addiction are a combination of a genetic predisposition with an event/substance that initiates the disorder; I don't know whether the genetic predisposition has any advantages.</p><p>This is why I'm <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/12/against-against-autism-cures/">sometimes friendly towards, but other times skeptical of, the "neurodiversity" movement</a>. Many autistic people say that autism is just another, equally good, way to be human, not a disease that requires a cure. I think this is completely true for some autistic people - the ones at a different point in tradeoff-space, who are still on the genetic Pareto frontier of inclusive fitness. I think it's absolutely false for other autistic people, the ones who got that way through brain injuries or in utero infections, and tend to be found in institutions having seizures or trying to bite their own fingers off. Instead of insisting that psychiatric conditions cannot possibly be bad for anybody and it's always just social prejudice all the way down, they would be better off admitting that this can be true for some people and false for others.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hidden Open Thread 159.5]]></title><description><![CDATA[Subscriber-only open thread]]></description><link>https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/hidden-open-thread-1595</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/hidden-open-thread-1595</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Alexander]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 22:27:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e964c10-7c6f-4b22-8831-594780df3ed3_612x583.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>null</p>

I know a lot of people throw shade on him for founding Vox. But as Van Gogh said about God creating the world, "We must not hold it against Him; only a master could make such a mistake". Ezra is a master and I was happy to be able to read his <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Were-Polarized-Ezra-Klein/dp/147670032X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1PI13D9PTU8VY&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=why+we%27re+polarized+by+ezra+klein&amp;qid=1612903262&amp;sprefix=why+we%27re+polarize%2Caps%2C268&amp;sr=8-1">Why We're Polarized</a></em>.</p><p>(Amazon recommended it to me as "Why We're Polarized By Ezra Klein", which I would also have been happy to read.)</p><p>Did you know that seventy years ago, our grandparents were having an underpolarization crisis? True! In 1950, the American Political Science Association "released a call to arms...pleading for a more polarized political system". The report argued that "the parties contain too much diversity of opinion and work together too easily, leaving voters confused about who to vote for and why". Everyone agreed with each other so much, and compromised so readily, that supporting one party over the other seemed almost pointless. </p><p>In 1976, three years after <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to support abortion restrictions. That same year, a poll found that "only 54% of the electorate believed that the Republican Party was more conservative than the Democratic Party"; 30% thought there was no difference. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/athe_polar3.png">As late as 2004</a>, about equal numbers (within 5 pp) of Democrats and Republicans agreed with statements like "government is almost always wasteful and inefficient" and "immigrants are a burden on our country". Between the late 60s and early 90s, Democratic presidents deregulated the airlines and passed welfare reform; Republican presidents pushed immigration amnesties and founded the EPA.</p><p>What happened between then and now? Klein has two answers: a historical answer, and a structural answer.</p><p>The historical answer is: the Dixiecrats switched from Democrat to Republican.</p><p>When the North won the Civil War, it had grand plans to remake the South into a paradise of racial equality and universal love. After Lincoln's death, his successor Andrew Johnson decided this sounded hard and gave up. Within a few decades, the South was back to being a racist, paramilitary-violence-prone one-party dictatorship. That one party called itself "Democrat", but had few similiarites to the Democrats in the North. The Southern Democrats ("Dixiecrats") and northern Democrats disagreed on lots of issues, but the South hated the Republicans so much after their experience with Lincoln that they caucused with the northern Democrats anyway. This turned into a stable coalition, with northern Democrats agreeing to support the South against civil rights for blacks, and the Dixiecrats supporting the northern Democrats whenever they needed something. </p><p>But since the Democratic party contained both northern Democrats (relatively liberal) and Dixiecrats (relatively conservative), it didn't want to take a coherent party-wide stance on liberalism vs. conservatism. And by the median voter theorem, that meant the Republicans also didn't want to take a coherent stance on liberalism vs. conservatism. So both parties ended out centrist and identical.</p><p>In 1964, the Civil Rights Act threatened the Dixiecrats' key issue. It wasn't quite as simple as "Democrats were for it, Republicans were against it" - in fact, 80% of Republicans and 60% of Democrats supported it. But that year's presidential election pitted heavily pro-CRA Democrat Lyndon Johnson against anti-CRA Republican Barry Goldwater, beginning Southerners' defection to the Republican Party. </p><p>Klein says this successfully got all the conservatives on one side of the aisle and all the liberals on the other, allowing polarization to begin. Essentially, he believes polarization is a natural process, which the odd coalitions of the early 20th century temporarily prevented. Once the coalitions were broken, it could begin to do its work. He spends the rest of the book talking about why exactly polarization is so natural, what aspects of modernization have made it worse, and what sort of feedback loops make it keep going. Some highlights:</p><p><em>1. Alignment of identities</em></p><p>Here Klein draws on the usual research around ingroups and outgroups. He says that we naturally have many different ingroups and outgroups, ie identities. For example, I am white, Jewish, Californian, and well-off. In the world of the 1960s, these might have been split across the two parties - one party would be more popular among Jews, the other more popular in California, and overall it would be kind of a wash. But starting after the Civil Rights Act, the parties begin to align on identities, so that now popular identities like "white male evangelical Protestant farmer" and "poor city-dwelling Muslim factory worker" fit entirely into one party. That party becomes our Ingroup, with a capital I, and the rest follows from there.</p><p>I'm not sure I fully understood Klein's explanation of exactly how this happened. After all, since identities are not 100% correlated (ie not all farmers are Protestant and not all city-dwellers are poor), you can't actually do this for the whole population at once. I think Klein would say that these correlations went from kind of random, to the ones that capture the biggest slice of the population. So maybe in the 1960s the party that best represented Protestants might not be the party that best represented farmers, even though farmers were disproportionately Protestant, but in the new era of polarization that's like a $20 bill left on the ground until some party can synchronize and capture both of those identities.</p><p>But also, maybe polarization changes identities? Maybe farmers became more religious, and non-farmers became less religious? I mean, something like this definitely seems to have happened: both parties were about equally religious until the 1980s, when Democrats abandoned religion <em>en masse</em> partly because it seemed like kind of a Republican thing. And sometimes polarization attracts based on identities - for example, gay people moving to the Democratic Party once homosexuality becomes a topic of debate.</p><p>If you're still a little confused by this part, that's fine - I am too.</p><p><em>2. Loss of geography</em></p><p>In the old days, when national news wasn't very cohesive and you mostly worried about your city council and state legislature, every state would have its own Democratic and Republican parties tailored to the needs of the state. Kansas would have its Kansas Republicans and its Kansas Democrats, centered around the median Kansas voter, and they would both do about equally well in Kansas. As cable TV, Internet, and fast travel made national news more of a thing, and people switched from local-politics-as-part-of-daily-life to national-politics-as-entertainment, it turned out that almost everyone in Kansas was more similar to everyone else in Kansas than any of them were to people in New York, and so Kansas went solid Republican and New York went solid Democrat. But a national Democratic Party that has to include Kansas Democrats under its tent is a Democratic Party that's going to naturally be a bit conservative, a bit sensitive to the interests of religious people, a bit sensitive to the interests of farmers, etc. Once you move from within-state sorting to national-level sorting, things get a lot more sorted very quickly.</p><p>Along with the nationalization of politics came a nationalization of news. In the old days, you either read the city paper or watched your one local news channel. Since these papers/channels had both Democratic and Republican readers, they would try pretty hard to avoid offending either group, and had some incentive towards objective journalism. Once cable and the Internet nationalized news consumption, business models shifted; now you could make more money by carving out an ideological niche among a national or global market of potential readers, and pandering to the identities and beliefs of your niche.</p><p><em>3. Negative polarization</em></p><p>Aligned identities don't necessarily make people more loyal to their own party; in fact, people are generally less pro-their-own-party than before.  In the 1960s, 80% of people were in a political party; nowadays only 63% are. In the 80s, people's average favorability rating for their own party was 72 on a 100 point scale; today it's only 63. So it's not the average voter has suddenly realized their party is great and super-important to them.</p><p>It's that they really, <em>really</em> hate the other guys.</p><p>This is called negative partisanship, and apparently it's the driver of our entire political system. This is especially true among independents - if you ask them why they voted for an R or D in a certain election, they're more likely to talk about hating and fearing the other party than about supporting their choice. But it seems to be true among partisans as well. One explanation for why Trump did so well among Republicans, despite his apparent forsaking of many Republican sacred cows on the campaign trail, was that he credibly promised to accomplish the one thing most Republicans want from their political leaders - not being a Democrat. Likewise, Joe Biden seems to be doing pretty well for himself right now based on a bold platform of not being Donald Trump. Klein believes this is pretty typical. He cites studies among Republicans showing that increasing some measure of liking Republicans one unit only makes them 3% more likely to donate to a campaign; increasing the same measure of hating Democrats the same amount makes them 11% more likely (there are similar numbers for the other side).</p><p>I don't feel like I totally understand this one either. Maybe one way to look at it is as a feedback loop. Democrats hate and fear the Republicans, which convinces them to rally around the party line and become further left, less subtle, and less civil. Republicans see these leftier, more confrontational Democrats, hate and fear them more, and become further right, less subtle, and less civil. And so on forever. I think something like this is definitely happening, though I wish I had a better model of it, and I'm not sure it's exactly what the book meant in this section.</p><p><em>4. Republicans suck</em></p><p>Klein argues that although polarization has affected both sides, the Democrats have managed to muddle on, but the Republicans have gone completely off the rails. </p><p>Stop for a second before reacting here. I get the impression that Klein understands he is taking a risk (not an actual risk of decreased popularity, given the givens, but some kind of metaphysical risk to his soul) by abandoning his previous attempt at a neutral stance and coming out like this. I think he feels bad about it, and that he considered not writing this chapter on that basis. I think it's very important to him that we consider the possibility that he <em>wants</em> to be neutral, is trying as hard as he can to be neutral, but that even from an attempted-neutral point of view he thinks the decline of the Republican Party is a threat to the stability of the country. And I think it's very important that we maintain a stance where we recognize this is a potentially true state of affairs - it really is possible that one party is much worse than the other! - and don't automatically condemn Klein for raising the possibility.</p><p>That having been said, I don't think he acquits himself well here. Some of his arguments aren&#8217;t great (the Republicans "launched a bizarre and unpopular campaign to impeach Clinton", but Clinton was obviously okay and didn't deserve impeachment, so the GOP has gone crazy and is a threat to democracy). He refers to data "showing Congressional Republicans have moved further left than Democrats have moved right", which I <em>think</em> is a typo (isn't the usual argument that Republicans have moved further right than Democrats have moved left?) but he never gets around to presenting it, instead gesturing at how it's obvious by looking at the Trump campaign vs. the Clinton campaign. This does not seem obvious to me. Trump holds basically the same positions that Americans in the mainstream of either party would have held in a less polarized time (eg 1995); Clinton holds positions that everyone in 1995 (including her husband) would have thought insane, radical, and ultra-far-left. </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/ZachG932/status/1321315169314721793&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;This comports with what I've generally observed in my research on race and immigration attitudes: it's not that the avg.

It's rather that  Dems have moved much more quickly.. <img class="tweet-photo" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.substack.com%2Fmedia%2FElZBF08WoAMLK5H.jpg"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">October 28th 2020</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">70</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">327</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>(my own model here is that the social justice movement pioneered a much angrier, more radical, more in-your-face style of identity politics, and the conservative movement scrambled to figure out how to fight fire with fire despite a huge handicap (conservative identity politics based on white, male, etc identity are understandably taboo). They flailed around for a while, mostly failed, and are now experimenting with how far anger can go as a substitute for a coherent philosophy. Needless to say, this isn&#8217;t how Klein thinks about any this.)</p><p>But after a bit of this he regains his footing and segues into a stronger argument that might give even conservatives some food for thought. Klein notes that although both Democrats and Republicans have some extremists in their coalition, the institutional Democrats seem to be doing a better job preventing them from gaining power. In a purely structural sense, without getting into whether you believe they're morally equivalent or whatever, the democratic socialists/Bernie Sanders seem to be an "insurrection" comparable to the Tea Party/Trump on the Republican side. But the mainstream neoliberal Republicans surrendered to the Tea Party and to Trump in rapid succession, and the mainstream neoliberal Democrats are still resisting. The Democrats' Tea Party equivalent is probably AOC, but she and her allies are still a small minority in the Democratic caucus. And the Dem presidential nomination went to Joe Biden, a moderate who wouldn't look out of place running for president in 1988 (in fact...). <em>Why We're Polarized</em> was published too early to mention Biden in this context, but we can count him as a correct prediction for its theory. </p><p>Klein calls this "the Democratic party more successfully resisting polarization", and thinks of this as related to structural differences between the two parties. He says that the Republican Party represents the modal American on various characteristics, eg Christian (the most common religion), white (the most common race), straight (the most common sexual orientation), etc, whereas the Democrats represent everyone else (eg Muslims, Jews, atheists, and every minority religion; blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and every minority race; etc). That means the Republicans are more ideologically uniform - Christians are genuinely similar to other Christians, but Jews are only superficially similar to Muslims by virtue of their non-Christianness. That means ideology can't really capture the Democratic Party in the same way it captures the Republican Party. One point kind of in support of this - ask Democrats their favorite news source, and you get a long tail of stuff (most popular is CNN at 15%, then NPR at 13%, and so on). But ask conservatives and it's dominated by FOX (47%). Does this lack of news-source diversity reflect a lack of ideological diversity? Could be. </p><p>But I'm not sure I can really go along with the conclusion, since there is a very obvious ideology which has captured the Democratic Party, it's based <em>exactly</em> on uniting non-modal people against modal ones (ie "intersectionality"), and it's at least as zealous and viral as anything the Republicans have been able to dream up. A Republican writing a similar book might argue that although the Republicans have the advantage of being able to say "We have beliefs/characteristics X, Y, and Z", the Democrats have the advantage of being able to say "People with beliefs/characteristics X, Y, and Z are the enemy". And Klein has already shown that negative partisanship is more powerful than positive partisanship! Having a clearly defined set of people to be against can be more unifying than being anyone in particular yourself. </p><p>(also, it&#8217;s not like CNN is mostly black, NPR is mostly Hispanic, or anything like that, so I don&#8217;t know what point the news source thing is supposed to prove.)</p><p>Klein understands he's supposed to end the book with a collection of suggestions for how to be less polarized. He is not sure he wants to do this. Nonpolarization rested on a gentleman's agreement to continue racism, which was bad. Voters benefit from having two clear alternatives to choose from. We Should Not Take A Rosy-Eyed View Of An Idealized Past. Plus he isn't sure we could end polarization even if we wanted to.</p><p>But he suggests we also do some things to make sure polarization doesn't cause national collapse or a civil war or something. He suggests fixing the Supreme Court (eg having more justices, with fixed-year terms) so that there aren't constant crises about who gets to pick the swing vote. He wants to do something about the debt ceiling and other "ticking time bombs" where if the parties don't agree, it causes some kind of disaster. And he suggests granting statehood to Puerto Rico and DC, because the better the electoral calculus is for the Democrats, the more the Republicans will have to change their strategy, and maybe their new strategy won't involve them being evil racists, and then the Democrats won't have to be so justly and correctly polarized against them (am I being unfair? check page 257 and see for yourself). </p><p>Finally, he suggests some increased individual reflectivity and thoughtfulness on our own parts. If all of us just do a tiny bit each day to fight the polarization within ourselves, together we can form a growing tide of compassion and mutual understanding. Haha, yeah right.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>This hit basically the notes a book like this should hit, but I don't feel too much more enlightened about Why We're Polarized.</p><p>In particular, I wish there was a discussion of other countries. When I lived in Ireland for a few years in the mid-to-late 2000s, they seemed to have a system much like 1960s America, where nobody could tell you the difference between the two major parties (or, rather, they would wax rhapsodic about the parties' differing positions on a 1920s treaty, and then when you interrupted and said "no, I mean today", they would say "oh, no difference"). This was baffling to me. I would ask Irish people how they chose which party to vote for, and it would usually be something along the lines of "ah, we're a Fianna Fail family, always have been, always will be, someone from Fine Gael killed my great-grandpa during the war. Never bothered to look at either side's position on the issues, but still hope to get around to it one day." I can only aspire to this level of centrism.</p><p>The book itself doesn&#8217;t go international, but Klein did later follow up with <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/1/24/21076232/polarization-america-international-party-political">a Vox article</a>, whose highlight is this graph:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-936-1200" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73048384-ea28-47ec-9163-6ebef4da9ce3_1200x936.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73048384-ea28-47ec-9163-6ebef4da9ce3_1200x936.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/73048384-ea28-47ec-9163-6ebef4da9ce3_1200x936.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A chart showing Cross-Country Trends in Affective Polarization by Country&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="A chart showing Cross-Country Trends in Affective Polarization by Country"><style>

There is no consistent trend toward more polarization in the First World! As Klein points out, this is a strong challenge to any story relying on digital media or social media or the changing media landscape.</p><p>But also: the average country at the average time is about as polarized as the US is now. This confirms Klein&#8217;s thesis that the US isn&#8217;t in a historically unprecedented state of hyperpolarization. It&#8217;s coming out of a period of unusually low polarization, into a more normal era. We may have gotten a little more polarized than average in the past few years, but only a little. So Klein&#8217;s question is: does that mean we&#8217;ll eventually even out at a normal level of polarization? Or are we briefly passing through normal on our way from &#8220;super low&#8221; to &#8220;super high&#8221;? (Peter Turchin <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/02/book-review-ages-of-discord/">has opinions</a>!)</p><p>So probably we should be looking for US-specific factors that would have made us abnormally bipartisan in the past, and which are now winding down. And this must be why Klein is so interested in the history of the Dixiecrats: they&#8217;re a US-specific factor that happens at just the right time to explain an otherwise anomalous dip in partisanship.</p><p>Does the time course of polarization match an origin around the 1964 Civil Rights Act?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-671-1077" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8593ab3a-7041-4772-adc5-ef0f8687c35c_1077x671.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8593ab3a-7041-4772-adc5-ef0f8687c35c_1077x671.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8593ab3a-7041-4772-adc5-ef0f8687c35c_1077x671.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:671,&quot;width&quot;:1077,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:24806,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

In 1996, people were still making jokes about how Clinton vs. Dole was Tweedledee vs. Tweedledum. It also matches the US data from the cross-country study Klein cites - ignore the trend line they drew in and look at the actual data points, which are horizontal until a little after 2000. Normal people seem to have polarized long after Congress did, maybe as a separate event with a separate cause.</p><p>What role did race play in polarizing ordinary people? Klein repeats the usual platitude about how white Americans have started feeling "resentment" at the growing power of other races. I think that gets at something, but not in a very productive way - why now? An alternate framing might be something like: when America was 80 or 90% white, you couldn't really have race-based coalitions, because the non-white coalition would lose. As America becomes closer to 50% white, race-based coalitions start to be a viable strategy, especially if the non-white coalition can get some moderate level of white support. Since race is an emotional topic that lots of people feel invested in, as coalitions become more race-based, politics is going to get more polarized and emotional.</p><p>A Democrat like Klein would interpret this as Republicans promoting racism to scare whites into fearing minorities, and so voting more consistently Republican. A Republican might interpret this as Democrats fanning accusations of racism to scare minorities into fearing white people, and so voting more consistently Democrat. But why would either of these be happening more now? Even if both coalitions are mostly white, you can always benefit by adding a couple more white racists to one coalition, or a couple more scared minorities to another. If the slightest hint at one position or another scared away all white/minorities from your party, you'd wait until the 50% mark, but that doesn't seem to be happening - there are still plenty of white Democrats, and increasingly many Republicans of color. Overall it would surprise me if something like this wasn't involved, but I don't have a good model for why it would happen now as opposed to some other time, unless it's just downstream of increasing polarization in general. Also, I think ordinary people started polarizing in the Bush administration, and race wasn&#8217;t anywhere near as big a topic of discussion then; if people were polarizing because of race, they themselves didn&#8217;t seem to know about it.</p><p>Overall summary: It looks like Congress started polarizing around 1975, probably as a delayed reaction to the Dixiecrat split. Normal people didn&#8217;t really start polarizing until around 2000 - 2005, but the reasons seem less clear. It probably wasn&#8217;t because of technology and social media, which were happening in lots of other countries that didn&#8217;t follow the same course. It might have been a very delayed reaction to Congress, or a very confusing reaction to racial demographics, or something something inequality and the economy (though nobody has been able to fill in the something something). I still don&#8217;t feel like I understand this very well.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>Klein ends by saying he cannot be entirely against polarization. But his arguments are unconvincing. I much prefer the Ezra Klein who writes things like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/22/21228469/marc-andreessen-build-government-coronavirus">Why We Can't Build: America's Inability To Act Is Killing People</a>.</p><p>Here he makes all of the impassioned and convincing arguments he avoided in his book: America used to be a great country that could do things like land people on the moon or win the Cold War. Now we seem pathetic, unable to handle even the most basic tasks of governance. Our economy is still as good as ever, our people are still among the brightest and most patriotic in the world, but our government no longer functions. Polarization is the culprit. We cannot pass laws that need to be passed. We cannot repeal laws that need to be repealed. Both parties are in such <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">intense competition</a>, optimizing so hard for scoring temporary PR victories over the other, that there is no <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/12/studies-on-slack/">slack </a>to devote to governing the country well. Instead of turning our energy against external enemies like poverty or the coronavirus or China, we expend it all in a massive propaganda campaign telling each half of the country to hate each other even more than it already does. Polarization is an existential threat to our way of life, the ur-problem creating all the hundreds of little problems we seethe and fume about every day.</p><p>(can polarization really have such major effects? <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/02/book-review-ages-of-discord/">Peter Turchin thinks</a> of polarization as one aspect of a general trend towards more or less conflict in societies. The polarization does not directly and solely cause the trend - it's a combination of many things interacting - but it's a contributing factor. He links high points in polarization levels to low wages, poor health, and even organized violence.)</p><p>Klein links this polarization to "vetocracy", the idea that it's impossible to do anything nowadays because somebody will prevent you. Sometimes this is a literal presidential veto. Other times, it can be something as stupid and venal as the party out of power using filibusters and every other dirty trick to make sure nothing improves, because if something did improve the party in power would get the credit. Klein thinks this explains everything from our inability to fix health care to an infrastructure that continues crumbling even though both parties say they support infrastructure reform.</p><p>The article doesn't have enough space to make a formal case for this, and for whatever reason these themes are muted in Klein's 250-page book. But I find it plausible. We all feel like something has gone wrong. The time course sort of matches. I'll probably post another essay on the article later this week to discuss my concerns about it. But overall I find it compelling. </p><p>Every so often, people ask what an effective altruism of politics would look like. If you had some limited number of resources, and you wanted to improve (US) politics as much as possible so that the government made better decisions and better served its populace, what would you do? <em>Why We're Polarized</em> and the rest of Klein's oeuvre make a strong case that you would try to do something about polarization. Solve that, and a lot of the political pathologies of the past few decades disappear, and the country gets back on track. I am not sure I get too many answers from reading this book, but I appreciate the way it asks the right questions.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-160-106" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Z20YAYhttps://amzn.to/2Z20YAY"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcbfa418-df43-463f-a806-680cd73954a4_106x160.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fcbfa418-df43-463f-a806-680cd73954a4_106x160.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:160,&quot;width&quot;:106,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:106,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://amzn.to/2Z20YAYhttps://amzn.to/2Z20YAY&quot;}" alt=""><style>

Two of them seemed to be especially interesting.</p><p><strong><a href="https://polymarket.com/">Polymarket</a></strong> is another cryptocurrency-based prediction market. It's got about two dozen contracts open, and some of them are pretty big - $5 million plus! With that kind of money, we ought to be seeing some really good predicting! We're...not. Either there's a 6% chance that Donald Trump will be president again by March 31, or something's gone wrong. </p><p>Probably it's the second one. I tried to bet against Trump, but getting money into the market was pretty hard. You need USDCoins, a stablecoin related to Ethereum. Polymarket tries to let you buy them directly, but their app wanted me to give them a security code which never showed up, so I gave up on this. Instead I bought some USDC at Coinbase and tried to send them over. But along with the usual Ethereum gas fees, they have something called a relayer, which is supposed to collect my money and put it in my account. And it's apparently heavily backed up, and after two days my money is nowhere to be seen (though I believe them <a href="https://polymarket.medium.com/polymarket-relayer-community-announcement-31ac3b64c09d">when they say</a> that they're trying their hardest and it will probably percolate through the Ethereum network someday). Maybe everyone's having these kinds of issues and this is why the Trump contract hasn't adjusted? I'm not sure. I will keep you updated if my money ever materializes.</p><p><strong><a href="https://kalshi.com/">Kalshi </a></strong>is "the first regulated futures exchange dedicated to trading on event outcomes". As far as I can tell they actually did it. They got the government to agree to let them run a prediction market, regulated as investing rather than gambling. There will be a $25,000 max on contracts, so it might not be enough for the real whales, but that's still thirty times higher than existing prediction markets and enough to probably be a sea change. I talked to a representative who said they'll be "focused on creating markets in a few key categories such as climate, economics, geopolitics, energy, education, government, space, COVID, and technology", but that they remain open to potentially expanding to all sorts of other areas (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_Futures_Act">except onions,</a> which apparently have a very specific carve-out as something which it is illegal to have futures markets about, somebody please write a cyberpunk novel revolving around this). So far they're still setting things up, but they describe themselves as "ramping quickly towards launch". I am super psyched about this and will keep you all updated.</p><p>Getting back to <strong><a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/">Metaculus</a></strong>, let&#8217;s look at what they&#8217;ve got on AI:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-214-1043" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29d3cefe-10fa-400d-accb-e8a417313844_1043x214.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29d3cefe-10fa-400d-accb-e8a417313844_1043x214.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/29d3cefe-10fa-400d-accb-e8a417313844_1043x214.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:214,&quot;width&quot;:1043,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:28857,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

In 2016, DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaGo beat first Fan Hui, a medium-level professional Go player, and then Lee Sedol, a top professional Go player. This was one of the more unexpected events in AI history; everyone thought it would be a few more years before Go AIs were ready for prime time. We can see this on Metaculus; their prediction that a Go program would beat a professional went from 30% before the Fan Hui match to 90% afterwards (there was some debate on whether the Fan Hui match was official enough to count, so it wasn&#8217;t 100, but everyone agreed that beating Fan Hui meant the program could probably beat other people in more official settings.<br><br>After that people thought it was moderately likely AlphaGo could beat Lee Sedol too, and they were right.</p><p>Prediction markets clearly aren&#8217;t magic; they didn&#8217;t expect AlphaGo&#8217;s victory over Hui any more than anyone else did (maybe a little more than some other people? they did give it 30%). But it&#8217;s interesting being able to quantify the exact degree to which people thought it was unlikely at the time, and when exactly that changed. </p><p>Imagine how great this sort of thing will one day be for historians. With enough skill, you can sort of wring prediction markets out of history - <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13567/w13567.pdf">the price of Confederate bonds in early 1863 </a>implied that investors thought the South had a 42% chance of winning the Civil War.

Regarding the one on the left: they&#8217;re assuming that a superintelligence would massively increase world GDP, because a superintelligence could probably invent cheap fusion, nanobots, etc. So in a hard takeoff scenario - where it&#8217;s business as usual and then someone invents a complete recursively self-improving superintelligence in their basement -  we would go from normal GDP growth to sudden extreme GDP growth really fast. In a slower takeoff scenario, we&#8217;d go from IQ 100 AIs to IQ 110 AIs to IQ 120 AIs [&#8230;] and never have a sharp transition to superintelligence. Here there would be a gradual speedup in GDP growth ending with the kind of super-high growth you&#8217;d expect from fusion and nanobots.</p><p>Right now world GDP doubles every 20 years. So this is asking whether we will see a period of merely super-high GDP growth (doubling every 4 years) before we see a period of absurdly high GDP growth (doubling every 1 year). A yes answer means superintelligence won&#8217;t come as a complete surprise and takeoff won&#8217;t be too fast. Forecasters lean towards yes, but not especially confidently.</p><p>The one on the right is pretty weird. Right now world GDP is 80 trillion dollars. It&#8217;s forecast to reach maybe 200 trillion dollars by 2050. Forecasters have already said they&#8217;re expecting AGI in the 2035 - 2040 range. So this is saying they&#8217;re expecting world GDP to be much, much higher than business as usual. Presumably some AI-related advance short of AGI would cause an unprecedented world economic boom. I am pretty skeptical of this because there have been a lot of weird unprecedented things in economic history and they have never caused that severe a discontinuity. Looking at the distribution, I see most people agree with me and are predicting somewhere in the 100 - 200 trillion range, but other people are saying really far out there things and it all averages out.</p><p>Less weird, and closer to home:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-221-478" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae9db53d-6588-4e6a-aefc-eb8bfcd27bbf_478x221.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae9db53d-6588-4e6a-aefc-eb8bfcd27bbf_478x221.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae9db53d-6588-4e6a-aefc-eb8bfcd27bbf_478x221.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:221,&quot;width&quot;:478,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:12682,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

They've been trying to write a coronavirus article worthy of Zvi or any of the other illegibly smart people writing on the pandemic. Apparently the bottleneck is sources.</p><p>In most journalistic settings, you can't just write "here's what I think". You have to write "here's what my source, a recognized expert, said when I interviewed them". And the experts are pretty sparing with their interviews for contrarian stories.</p><p>The way my correspondent described it: sources don't usually get to approve the way they're quoted in an article, or to see it before it gets published. So they're really cagey about saying anything that might get misinterpreted. Maybe their real opinion is that X is a hard question, there are good points on both sides, but overall they think it probably isn't true. But if a reporter wants to write "X Is Dumb And All Epidemiologists Are Idiots For Believing It", they can slice and dice your interview until your cautiously-skeptical-of-X statement sounds like you're backing them up. So experts end up paranoid about saying potentially-controversial-sounding things to reporters. And since reporters can't write without sources, it's hard for them to write anything controversial about epidemiology.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1356975113191776256&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;I'm sort of fascinated by the gaps between what's considered canonical knowledge about COVID in high-prestige news outlets, and what you learn about it if you obsessively follow the research, e.g. preprints, experts' twitter threads, etc.&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;NateSilver538&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Nate Silver&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Wed Feb 03 14:37:33 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:78,&quot;like_count&quot;:1082,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{}}"><a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1356975113191776256" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/NateSilver538.jpg"><span class="tweet-author-name">Nate Silver </span><span class="tweet-author">@NateSilver538</span></div>I'm sort of fascinated by the gaps between what's considered canonical knowledge about COVID in high-prestige news outlets, and what you learn about it if you obsessively follow the research, e.g. preprints, experts' twitter threads, etc.<div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">February 3rd 2021</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">78</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">1,082</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>Since experts always worry their position will get stripped of nuance, the ones who give interviews at all try to err on whatever side, after getting stripped of nuance, will be least likely to sound like &#8220;Experts are dumb, health advice is meaningless, you might as well go eat bats&#8221;. That usually means saying vaguely reassuring prosocial things which, when stripped of nuance, still sound like vaguely reassuring prosocial things. Any expert who says something other than that is putting their reputation at risk. Not in a subtle way, either - if this goes wrong, it goes wrong on the front page of the newspaper!</p><p>I think this is broadly in keeping with it being easier to produce illegible knowledge (an expert posting on Twitter that they think the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine needs to be approved faster, or a random person looking at the evidence and deciding this) than legible knowledge (that same fact making it onto the front page of a newspaper). Probably one solution is for reporters to make their sources feel more comfortable, but my understanding is most reporters already put a lot of work into cultivating sources, there are only a few bad apples, but sources don't know who those are and generally stay shy.</p><p>The person who talked to me about this seems pretty trustworthy, so if any of you are legibly-expert epidemiologists, have some good but under-reported COVID opinions, and are willing to grant interviews about them, send me an email at scott@slatestarcodex.com and I'll pass your information on.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[WebMD, And The Tragedy Of Legible Expertise]]></title><description><![CDATA[What does running a medical database teach you about why everything sucks?]]></description><link>https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/webmd-and-the-tragedy-of-legible</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/webmd-and-the-tragedy-of-legible</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Alexander]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 21:54:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c164b79f-835d-4010-a364-91591a857eaf_417x436.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>I started a small database of psychiatry information. It's going well. I'm grateful for all your emails suggesting changes and corrections. Sort of.</p><p>Here are some of the kinds of emails I get:</p><p><strong>"You said this drug is occasionally mildly addictive but the risk/benefit calculation is worth it for most people. But my cousin's friend took it and became really addicted and it ruined his life. Maybe you should warn readers about it more emphatically."</strong> The particular example I'm thinking of is something exotic, but alcohol or Adderall could equally well be in this category. Still, I get nervous whenever I get emails like this. What if I do ruin somebody's life? Maybe I should just change the wording to "this drug has some benefits but is often addictive, be careful with it"?</p><p><strong>"You listed three major side effects of this drug, but I got a side effect that isn't on your list. Maybe you should add it in."</strong> All drugs have an infinite number of possible side effects. One in a zillion people who use Naproxen ("Aleve") becomes red-green colorblind. Capecitabine ("Xeloda") can sometimes make you lose your fingerprints, which sucks if your computer has biometric security. If listed all side effects of anything, we would be here all day. Still, I get nervous when I get emails like this. What if an interior designer takes Aleve, loses their color vision, and it's my fault for not warning them?</p><p><strong>"You said Drug A is better for most people than Drug B. But I tried Drug A and it was terrible, then I tried Drug B and it cured everything. I think you need to make it clearer that Drug B can be better than Drug A sometimes."</strong> Investing in index funds is usually better than investing in lottery tickets, but one guy will get a winning lottery ticket on the day the stock market crashes and have the opposite result; it's still valuable to warn investors that one thing is better than another. On the other hand, The Last Psychiatrist blames overly facile Drug A/Drug B comparisons for <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2009/04/how_dangerous_is_academic_psyc_1.html">killing David Foster Wallace</a>. Do I want to kill David Foster Wallace? Sometimes, when I think about all the loose ends in <em>Infinite Jest</em> - but most of the time no.</p><p><strong>"You listed some funny facts about this disorder, but this disorder is really serious and killed my grandmother".</strong> I have a lot of trouble being serious, and this has served me well in getting people to read and enjoy things I write. But almost everything in medicine has killed at least one person's grandmother. Obviously you should be sensitive, but can you never mention any of the weird and hilarious things that go on in psychiatry?</p><p>In some sense I do appreciate all of this feedback; even when I don't take it, it helps compensate for my own biases. Still, there's a thin line between a compliment from an architecture connosseiur and a threat from a mafioso: "Nice house you have there, shame if something were to happen to it". In the same way, there's a thin line between helpful suggestions related to medicine and veiled threats of lawsuits, cancellation, and the like. </p><p>For each individual case, the temptation is to retreat. "Yeah, sorry, I forgot to list this side effect which is obviously very important to you", "Yeah, in retrospect it is a little offensive to be joking about a heavily stigmatized disorder". For each individual case, this is fine.</p><p>My fear is that if I do this enough, I become WebMD.</p><p>WebMD is the Internet's most important source of medical information. It's also surprisingly useless. Its most famous problem is that whatever your symptoms, it'll tell you that you have cancer. But the closer you look, the more problems you notice. Consider drug side effects. Here's WebMD's list of side effects for a certain drug, let's call it Drug 1:</p><blockquote><p>Upset stomach and heartburn may occur. If either of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly. If your doctor has directed you to use this medication, remember that he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects. Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: easy bruising/bleeding, difficulty hearing, ringing in the ears, signs of kidney problems (such as change in the amount of urine), persistent or severe nausea/vomiting, unexplained tiredness, dizziness, dark urine, yellowing eyes/skin. This drug may rarely cause serious bleeding from the stomach/intestine or other areas of the body. If you notice any of the following very serious side effects, get medical help right away: black/tarry stools, persistent or severe stomach/abdominal pain, vomit that looks like coffee grounds, trouble speaking, weakness on one side of the body, sudden vision changes or severe headache.</p></blockquote><p>And here's their list of side effects for let's call it Drug 2:</p><blockquote><p>Nausea, loss of appetite, or stomach/abdominal pain may occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly. Remember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects. This medication can cause serious bleeding if it affects your blood clotting proteins too much. Even if your doctor stops your medication, this risk of bleeding can continue for up to a week. Tell your doctor right away if you have any signs of serious bleeding, including: unusual pain/swelling/discomfort, unusual/easy bruising, prolonged bleeding from cuts or gums, persistent/frequent nosebleeds, unusually heavy/prolonged menstrual flow, pink/dark urine, coughing up blood, vomit that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, severe headache, dizziness/fainting, unusual or persistent tiredness/weakness, bloody/black/tarry stools, chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing.</p></blockquote><p>Drug 1 is aspirin. Drug 2 is warfarin, which causes 40,000 ER visits a year and is widely considered one of the most dangerous drugs in common use. I challenge anyone to figure out, using WebMD's side effects list alone, that warfarin is more dangerous than aspirin. I think this is because if WebMD said "aspirin is pretty safe and most people don't need to worry about it", people might use aspirin irresponsibly, die, and then their ghosts might sue WebMD. Or if WebMD said "warfarin can be dangerous, be careful with this one", people might refuse to take warfarin because "the Internet said it was dangerous", die of the stuff warfarin is supposed to treat, and then their ghosts might sue WebMD. WebMD solves this by never giving the tiniest shred of useful information to anybody.</p><p>This is actually a widespread problem in medicine. The worst offender is the FDA, which tends to list every problem anyone had while on a drug as a potential drug side effect, even if it obviously isn't. This got some press lately when Moderna had to disclose to the FDA that one of the coronavirus vaccine patients <a href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/news-moderna-volunteer-struck-by-lightning-month-after-receiving-vaccine-20201219">got struck by lightning</a>; after a review, this was declared probably unrelated. For the more serious version of this, read <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects">Get Ready For False Side Effects</a>. Why does the FDA keep doing this if they know it makes their label information useless? My guess is it's because they don't want to look like cowboys who unprincipledly consider some things but not other things. What if someone accused the person deciding what things to consider of being biased? So the FDA comes up with a Procedure, and once you have a Procedure it has to be "take everything seriously", and then it falls on random small-fry people who aren't the FDA to pick up the slack and explain which side effects are worth worrying about or not, and then those small fries don't do that, because they could get sued.</p><p>I think the same concern motivates WebMD diagnosing everything as cancer. If they said something other than cancer, then people might sigh with relief, not bother to get a cancer screening, die from some weird cancer that doesn't present the way normal cancers do, and then their ghosts might sue WebMD.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-372-680" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f836147-a1f2-4ae1-8b87-18b603aa290b_680x372.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f836147-a1f2-4ae1-8b87-18b603aa290b_680x372.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2f836147-a1f2-4ae1-8b87-18b603aa290b_680x372.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:372,&quot;width&quot;:680,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="Image"><style>

This isn't because I'm smarter or more of an expert than whoever WebMD employs. It's because I'm small enough to have a sort of security by obscurity.</p><p>If some bad thing will happen to one in a million people who read my site - they take Drug A because I said it was better for most people, but it was worse for them, and it injures them - probably my site will never get a million readers and I won't have to worry about it. WebMD gets a million readers a day and worries about it a lot.</p><p>If some lawyer with dollar signs in their eyes where the pupils should be reads my website, they know I'm not rich enough to be worth their time. WebMD is definitely rich enough to be worth their time.</p><p>If I think it's helpful to mention politically incorrect stereotypes (is it true that disproportionately many borderline personality cases are young women with lots of piercings and tattoos? what does that tell us about diagnosis and etiology?) I can do that, knowing that I'm probably not worth the mob's time to cancel. Also, I'm my own boss and don't have to worry about getting hauled in front of WebMD's Chief Diversity Officer.</p><p>If I think it's helpful to have a personal opinion on something (eg which antidepressants are scams), I can write my personal opinion without having a boss who can tell me to stop being a cowboy and devise a Procedure instead. I don't really have to worry that the pharmaceutical companies whose antidepressants I am calling scams will care enough to sue me for libel, or destroy my reputation, or lock me out of cool biotech industry meetings, or whatever.</p><p>The essence of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch </a>is that if you want to win intense competitions, you have to optimize for winning intense competitions - not for some unrelated thing like giving good medical advice. Google apparently has hard-coded into their search algorithm that WebMD should be on the front page for any medical-related search; I would say they have handily won the intense competition that they're in. They must have placated a wide variety of stakeholders and fought off a wide variety of attackers; each of those victories took a minor change to their medical information or their procedures for producing medical information. Repeat a thousand times, and they're on top of the world, and also every diagnosis is "cancer" and every drug's side effects are "everything".</p><p>WebMD is too big, too legitimate, and too canonical to be good.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci is the WebMD of people.</p><p>At least this is the impression I get from this <a href="https://www.thedriftmag.com/the-case-against-fauci/">rather hostile biography</a>. He's a very smart and competent doctor, who wanted to make a positive difference in the US medical establishment, and who quickly learned how to play the game of flattering and placating the right people in order to keep power. In the end, he got power, sometimes he used it well, and other times he struck compromises between using it well and doing dumb things that he needed to do to keep his position.</p><p>I don't want to judge him. Everyone has to make their own compromise between morally-pure-but-useless and tainted-but-useful, and I think Fauci comes out better than many. This isn't about judgment. </p><p>This is about, well - in 2015, if you and a few of your weird friends beat the experts, it was new and exciting. You would prance around, singing "We beat the experts! We beat the experts!" In 2021 it's just depressing. Are the experts okay? Do they need help? Blink once for yes, twice for no...</p><p>I can't tell you how many times over the past year all the experts, the CDC, the WHO, the <em>New York Times</em>, et cetera, have said something (or been silent about something in a suggestive way), and then some blogger I trusted <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695">said the opposite</a>, and the blogger turned out to be right. I realize this kind of thing is vulnerable to selection bias, but it's been the same couple of bloggers throughout, people who I already trusted and already suspected might be better than the experts in a lot of ways. <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/">Zvi Mowshowitz</a> is the first name to come to mind, though there are many others. </p><p>There are all sorts of places you could go with this. Maybe expertise is a sham, and a smart guy thinking for five minutes can outdo a decade of working on a PhD. Maybe Joe Biden is an idiot for not appointing Zvi the Secretary of Health. Maybe the whole system is a plot to keep good people down, and we need to burn it down and start over again. Or maybe I'm dumb and biased, and actually the experts are doing much better than Zvi but I'm selectively misinterpreting evidence until I think they aren't.</p><p>Probably all of these have a grain of truth in them. But I find myself settling on a different explanation, which is something like this:</p><p>When Zvi asserts an opinion, he has only one thing he's optimizing for - being right - and he does it well.</p><p>When the Director of the CDC asserts an opinion, she has to optimize for two things - being right, and keeping power. If she doesn't optimize for the second, she gets replaced as CDC Director by someone who does. That means she's trying to solve a harder problem than Zvi is, and it makes sense that sometimes, despite having more resources than Zvi, she does worse at it.</p><p>The way I imagine this is that Zvi reads some papers on whether the coronavirus has airborne transmission, sees the direction they're leaning, and announces on his blog that it probably has airborne transmission.</p><p>The Director of the CDC reads those same papers. But some important Senator says that if airborne transmission is announced, important industries in his state will go bankrupt. Citizens Against Lockdowns argues that the CDC already screwed up by stressing the later-proven-not-to-exist fomite-based transmission, ignoring the needs of ordinary people in favor of a bias towards imagining hypothetical transmission mechanisms that never materialize; some sympathetic Congressman tells the director that if she makes that same mistake a second time, she's out. One of the papers saying that airborne transmission is impossible comes from Stanford, and the Director owes the dean of Stanford's epidemiology department a favor for helping gather support for one of her policies once. So the Director puts out a press release saying the evidence is not <em>quite</em> strong enough to say airborne transmission definitely happens, and they'll review it further.</p><p>I realize it doesn't sound like it, but I'm trying to excuse the CDC here. I'm not just saying they're corrupt. I'm saying they have to deal with the inevitable amount of corruption which it takes to be part of a democratic government, and they're handling it as well as they can under the circumstances. </p><p>Expertise isn't a sham. The Director of the CDC could generate opinions as accurate as (or more accurate than) Zvi's, if she wanted to. Maybe she's even doing that internally, when she decides what precautions she and her family should take. Or maybe she isn't; I know a lot of people who have turned into the mask they put on to succeed, just because it's easier that way. The Director may carefully avoid being the kind of person who can generate opinions more accurate than the ones she has to officially endorse; this is probably the best option for her mental health.</p><p>Joe Biden can't appoint Zvi as CDC Director, at least not usefully. If Biden appointed Zvi as Director one of three things would happen. One, Zvi would learn to play politics as adroitly as the current Director, and lose his advantage over her. Two, Zvi would offend enough people that they would pressure Biden to fire him. Or three, Zvi would offend people, Biden would offend people by not firing Zvi, and eventually Biden would fall beneath some necessary threshold of support and not be able to be an effective President. I'm not saying that just appointing Zvi would inevitably get Biden impeached. I'm saying Biden has a certain amount of slack, given how many people he needs to keep happy in order to govern effectively, and appointing Zvi as CDC Director would use up so much of that slack that he couldn't do other equally useful things later without becoming ineffective and likely to lose reelection.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>The first reason I'm talking about this now is to respond to a point that came up in my discussions with Glen Weyl on technocracy.</p><p>I think Weyl thinks of the world like this: some experts make a plan. But experts are often biased or corrupt. So if we expose the plan to lots of democratic feedback, then ordinary people, who aren't biased or corrupt, will drag it in the direction of being better.</p><p>Sometimes this is true. But other times I use a different model. Some experts make a plan. Experts are sometimes unbiased and not-corrupt, at least insofar as it's possible for anyone to be unbiased and non-corrupt in this world. If you expose the plan to politics, the politics will drag it in the direction of being worse. Every feedback channel you open up is a way for somebody to attack you. </p><p>If you're planning the coronavirus response, maybe the best thing you can do is lock Zvi in a cave completely incommunicado and make him write one for you. The moment there's a gap in the cave, thousands of lobbyists and activists and politicians will rush in, trying to sue him or bribe him or threaten him or guilt him into changing it to favor their constituency. If he has the slightest shred of self-preservation, the end result will be some balance between the good plan he would have written earlier, and the stuff he needs to include to avoid getting sued or fired or cancelled or universally-loathed or mobbed. </p><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>The second reason I'm writing this is because people keep asking me "should we listen to experts"?</p><p>As usual, the answer is "it depends who you mean by we".</p><p>Here's a story which is very flattering and which I hope is true: Zvi gives better advice than the Director of the CDC. This isn't a very legible fact - it's not obvious from the titles each one has - but due to various personal advantages, like having known Zvi for ten years and thinking in the same idiom he does, I'm able to recognize this. I can take Zvi's advice instead of the Director's advice, and benefit from it.</p><p>(if you trust me, you probably also trust Zvi now that you&#8217;ve read this. But you only trust me because you&#8217;ve read me for years, think in the same idiom I do, etc, etc.)</p><p>Even if this flattering story is true, it doesn't scale. My personal tendency will be to always trust Zvi. But someone else will decide to always trust *their* friend, a guy in a MAGA cap who says coronavirus is fake and Dr. Fauci is a Satanist. Compared to the <em>median </em>person who disagrees with the experts, the experts look pretty good.</p><p>My household locked down two weeks before the general shelter-in-place order went out (this is entirely to the credit of one of my housemates, who did her homework really well). We beat the experts. But our workplaces mostly didn't; they were up and running until the government forced them to stop. Up until the moment the shelter-in-place order dropped, I kept hearing stories of parents trying to pull their kids out of public school, only to get told that their unfounded virophobia didn't matter and their children would be given failing grades if they didn't attend. The experts successfully swooped in and saved us from all of that, figuring out which way the wind was blowing only two weeks later than competent amateurs. This was a useful service. Without the experts, things would have stayed open forever.</p><p>Obviously the best case scenario would be that Zvi or whoever <em>was</em> the expert, and could have done what they did, only earlier. But this is assuming away the entire problem. What's the best form of government? Benevolent dictatorship, obviously, just get the best person in the country and let her fix everything. But everyone realizes this is easier said than done; the procedure to pick the best person is corruptible. At one point we tried a very simple best-person-picking procedure that really should have worked and ended up choosing Donald Trump as the best person. I'm still not really sure what went wrong there, but apparently this is really hard. </p><p>In this model, Zvi is illegibly good. It's easy for a random person to be illegibly good. They just do good things, and a few of their close friends who have known them for a long time notice they're good, and then those close friends reap the benefits.</p><p>Dr. Fauci (and WebMD) are legibly good (or at least legibly okay). They sit on a giant golden throne, with a giant neon arrow pointing to them saying "TRUST THIS GUY". If a random shmuck who doesn't know anything about anything Googles "who should I trust about COVID?", Google will return Dr. Fauci's name. This is a position of great power; Dr. Fauci is able to make decisions that will affect billions of dollars in wealth, Senate seats, Twitter likes, and other extremely valuable resources. Thousands of people who would prefer that <em>they</em> get the dollars and seats and likes will be gunning for him. In order to stay on that throne, Dr. Fauci will need to get and keep lots of powerful allies (plus be the sort of person who thinks in terms of how to get allies rather than being minimaxed for COVID-prediction). <br><br>This interferes with his COVID predicting ability, but in the current system there&#8217;s no alternative. You can't trivially put Zvi on that throne, any more than you could trivially make Zvi benevolent dictator of the world (another job I think he would be good at). One of the big differences between good and bad systems of government is how much they rely on corruption vs. meritocracy in putting people on those thrones, and our system of government is only mediocre. As the saying goes, "there are no First World countries".</p><p><strong>V.</strong></p><p>The third reason I'm writing this is to explain a sort of missing mood.</p><p>I think experts have failed terribly on easy problems. Shouldn't I be taking to the streets, pitchfork in hand, trying to burn down the system? Some of my friends are; they've gotten radicalized by all of this, a weird mix of far-left and far-right and I-don't-even-know-anymore-just-something-other-than-this. I'm not that radical. I continue to support gradual change. Isn't that weird?</p><p>What I sometimes call Marx's Fallacy is that if we burnt down the current system, some group of people who optimized for things other than power would naturally rise to the top. Wrong. People who most brutally and nakedly optimized for power would gain power; that's what "optimize" means. The interesting thing about the current system is that, after millions of very smart and altruistic people have contributed to it over generations, sometimes gaining and keeping power within it is modestly correlated with being good and right. The Director of the CDC isn't a COVID denialist. She's probably not even going to endorse Lysenkoism, at least not literally. That's because our system isn't as crappy as the Stalinist one, which failed so badly that endorsing Lysenkoism became a route to career success. In fact, the last Director of the CDC disagreed with his boss (Donald Trump) in a lot of cases where his boss was wrong; that never would have happened under Stalinism, and probably wouldn't happen in whatever system you'd get after burning ours to the ground. Our system of expert-having is actually much better than we deserve, given that we elected Donald Trump president. Making it better should still be our top priority, but we shouldn't lose sight of how much we've already got.</p><p>This means experts can play an important role; they're people who are legibly mediocre. Zvi is illegibly great, but there's no simple way to convert that to "legibly great" without sacrificing some of his greatness. I think our system for producing legibly-mediocre people is a good start. It doesn't always pick the most trustworthy people. But it almost always gets someone in the top 50%, sometimes the top 25%. There are few biologists who deny evolution, few epidemiologists who think vaccines don't work, and few economists who are outright communists.</p><p>Think of centers of expertise like the CDC or the IGM Economists Panel as giant systems for disentangling corruption and power. Their job is to produce one or two people who can get in front of the population and say something which has some resemblance to reality, even though <em>the entire rest of the economy and body politic is trying to corrupt them</em>. They...actually do sort of okay. Anthony Fauci is neither Attila the Hun nor Trofim Lysenko. He's a kind of bumbling careerist with a decent understanding of epidemiology and a heart that's more or less in the right place. The whole scientific-technocratic complex is a machine which takes Moloch as input and manages - after spending billions of dollars and the careers of thousands of hard-working public servants - to produce Anthony Fauci as output. This should be astonishing, and we are insufficiently grateful.</p><p>(but prediction markets would still be better)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hidden Open Thread 158.5]]></title><description><![CDATA[Only 1.5 days late!]]></description><link>https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/hidden-open-thread-1585</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/hidden-open-thread-1585</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Alexander]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 07:42:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a3a5ac28-87a1-4da2-8c17-67f33c5e5bd6_612x583.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>null</p>

Luckily, as long as she has a  job, she will have health insurance. And health insurance provides her  with a treatment. Every day she takes the treatment, her health will go  up one point on a 0-100 scale; every day she misses the treatment, it  will go down one point. If her health ever gets below 75, she will be  too ill to work.</p><p>Mathematicians would call this <em>a dynamical system with three variables</em>: does she have a <strong>j</strong>ob or not, does she have <strong>i</strong>nsurance or not, and her <strong>h</strong>ealth  level. We know from the rules above that j always equals i, and that j  is 1 as long has h is 75 or higher. And every day i = 1, h goes up one;  every day i = 0, h goes down 1.</p><p>Alice starts with a job and health of 100. Since j = 1 and i = 1,  health goes up one each day, but it&#8217;s maxed out at 100 so it just says  there. This state is perfectly stable; as long as the system follows the  rules above, it will never change.</p><p>Suppose Alice gets a mild cold which knocks her health down to 90.  She keeps working, her health keeps going up 1 each day, and she  eventually gets back to 100.</p><p>Suppose Alice gets a medium flu which knocks her health down to 80.  She keeps working, her health keeps going up 1 each day, and she  eventually gets back to 100.</p><p>But suppose Alice gets a serious pneumonia which knocks her health  down to 70. Now she can&#8217;t work, she loses insurance, her health starts  going down 1 each day, and she eventually goes down to 0. This is  another stable state; as long as the system keeps evolving according to  the rules, it will never change.</p><p>Let&#8217;s be more specific: the mathematicians would call this <em>a dynamical system with three variables and two attractor states</em>.  An attractor state is a stable situation that tends to &#8220;suck&#8221; nearby  unstable situations into it. Alice having a job, insurance, and health  70 is an unstable situation; she will immediately get fired, lose her  insurance, and have her health start going down, until she reaches the  stable (j = 0, i = 0, h = 0) attractor. Likewise, Alice having no job,  no insurance, and health 90 is an unstable situation; she will get  hired, get insurance, and have her health start going up until she  reaches (j = 1, i = 1, h = 100). These are the only two stable  attractors; any other situation will eventually turn into one of those  two.</p><p>We can visualize this as a terrain with hills and basins:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-347-421" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b7e9c07-10d4-4166-b3a9-2077274711b8_421x347.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b7e9c07-10d4-4166-b3a9-2077274711b8_421x347.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3b7e9c07-10d4-4166-b3a9-2077274711b8_421x347.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:347,&quot;width&quot;:421,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

There are two possible basins of stability &#8211; Alice  having a job, insurance, and being healthy, and Alice having no job, no  insurance, and being sick. If something else is true, she will drift to  whichever of these two equilibria is closer.</p><p>This is an interesting twist to the recent discussion about  taxometrics; it introduces change over time. Two of the variables in our  system (job and health insurance) are categorical. One (health) is  dimensional &#8211; it can be anywhere from zero to 100. The system itself is  supposedly dimensional  (there are lots of places it could be) &#8211; but in  reality will mostly be categorical (it will tend to one of two very  different attractor states). Even health, a supposedly dimensional  variable, will tend towards either 0 or 100, making it look categorical.</p><p>Anyone measuring Alice&#8217;s health will occasionally find that it&#8217;s in  places other than 0 or 100; these are not logically impossible. But a  closer analysis will find that those two values are privileged and need  further investigation.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Bob gets sad sometimes. When he&#8217;s sad, he stays in his room and  refuses to talk to his friends. When he stays in his room and doesn&#8217;t  talk to his friends, that makes him feel sadder.</p><p>You can already tell this is going nowhere good. Think of this system as having two attractor states &#8211; Bob being happy and active, or Bob  being sad and inactive. Each attractor state is stable until acted upon  by an outside force. So happy active Bob will stay happy and active <em>until</em>  (for example) he has a bad breakup with his girlfriend, after which he  gets pushed into the (sad, inactive) state and stays there until  something else changes.</p><p>According to the DSM, depression has eight core symptoms: low mood,  lack of interest in activities, appetite change, slow movements,  tiredness, feelings of worthlessness, poor concentration, and  suicidality. You could imagine a dynamical system among all these  variables, with each doing complicated things to the others, until they  settled into some kind of attractor or other.</p><p>And by &#8220;you could imagine&#8221; I mean &#8220;Borsboom et al have mapped this&#8221;:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-551-700" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a36f073-fadd-43a1-9cc5-116b9b42798a_700x551.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a36f073-fadd-43a1-9cc5-116b9b42798a_700x551.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7a36f073-fadd-43a1-9cc5-116b9b42798a_700x551.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:551,&quot;width&quot;:700,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

On a steep slope, it will roll very quickly; on  near-level ground, it will roll more slowly to start with. This is the  phenomenon of <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/critical-slowing-warns-of-looming-disasters-20151118/">critical slowing-down</a>, observed in dynamical systems as diverse as <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/critical-slowing-warns-of-looming-disasters-20151118/">predatory largemouth bass populations</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144198">the global economy</a>. Borsboom et al find it also applies to depression: when someone is right at the threshold for being depressed, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/1/87">their mood is unusually stable for a short period</a> before finally collapsing into depression or normalcy. </p><p>(also, some dynamical systems oscillate wildly between very low and  very high points, which is pretty suggestive of bipolar disorder)</p><p>People often ask: is depression the just same thing as normal  sadness? Taxometrics seems to lean towards yes &#8211; it cannot find a categorical  difference between major depressive disorder and normal low mood. But  I&#8217;m not entirely satisfied with that answer, and dynamical systems  theory offers a reason the answer might be no: depression is an  attractor state in a dynamical system including normal sadness and many other variables. Normal sadness goes away after a few days or weeks;  depression doesn&#8217;t.</p><p>So have Borsboom et al solved depression? I don&#8217;t think so. We know <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/05/chronic-psychitis/">inflammation plays a major role in depression</a>,  so any dynamical systems perspective that doesn&#8217;t include a little circle for inflammation is going to be missing a lot of the picture. But  the same is true of circadian rhythm, thyroid status, folate levels,  and trauma history. Can you ever graph all of this effectively? Wouldn&#8217;t  the graph start becoming so big and so complex that we stopped being  able to conceive of it as a system at all?</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>Imagine some benevolent aliens surveilling Earth from orbit. They  don&#8217;t understand our languages, and their own culture is so exotic that  even basic ideas like &#8220;money&#8221; or &#8220;war&#8221; are hard for them to  understand. Still, they have good telescopes, and they&#8217;re able to  measure things like how much light our cities have,  how much traffic is on our roads and sea-lanes, and how much smoke our  industries emit.</p><p>After a while, they notice all these things are correlated. There are  some years (for example late 1929 and the early 1930s) when city lighting, smoke emissions, and traffic all stagnate. In other years (like the late 1990s), all these things grow even faster than usual.  After analyzing word frequency in human communications, they hypothesize  that the former type of period corresponds to English &#8220;recession&#8221; and the latter period to &#8220;boom&#8221;. By performing sentiment analysis of human faces in the media during these periods, they hypothesize that we dislike recessions.</p><p>These are benevolent aliens, and they want us to be happy, so they wonder how to prevent recessions. Sometime during the 1970s, they notice that during a recession, there are fewer oil tankers leaving the Middle East, and longer lines at First World gas stations. They know enough chemistry to realize that oil is a pretty useful fuel at our stage of  technological development, so they deduce that the recession  is caused by an oil shortage. This seems solveable! Using their  Materialization Ray, they cause one billion barrels of crude oil to  appear on the White House lawn.</p><p>This actually helps a lot! Light, traffic, and industrial emissions  all return to normal. Sentiment analysis of human faces reveal a brief  period of extreme confusion, followed by happiness. The aliens have  successfully solved the recession.</p><p>In 2020, they notice another profound decrease in lighting, traffic,  and factory smoke; looks like another recession. The aliens, still  wanting to help and now confident they know how, materialize another billion barrels of crude oil on the White House lawn. The Earthlings continue sheltering in place from the coronavirus, but now they also  have to deal with a billion random barrels of oil tumbling around Washington DC. The aliens have solved nothing.</p><p>These aliens are friends with the aliens simulating the universe, so  they get a bunch of copies of Earth and run a bunch of experiments,  until they feel like they really understand what&#8217;s going on. They present their results at the annual meeting of the Alien Planetwatchers Association (APA), and propose some general principles:</p><p>1. Recessions are <em>fractally complicated</em>. Not only do they have  different causes, but the causes have different causes, and so on to  infinity. For example, one recession might be caused by an oil shortage  and another by coronavirus. But even oil shortage recessions are heterogenous. Some might be caused by production problems in  oil-exporting countries. Others might be caused by political strife; the Arab countries place sanctions on the First World or vice versa. Still others might be caused by a shortage of supertankers to transport the oil. Still others might be caused by refinery failures that prevent crude oil from being turned into gasoline. Still others might be caused  by trucking capacity shortages that prevent refineries from shipping  gasoline to gas stations. Even that&#8217;s not enough layers; there are  dozens of possible reasons for trucking capacity shortages, from bad  weather, to labor disputes, to civic unrest, to a meteor hitting Detroit.</p><p>2. All of the possible causes of recessions interact with each other.  If there&#8217;s a labor dispute at the trucking companies, that means gasoline sits undistributed at the refineries. But also, it means First World nations stop buying oil from producers, which could crash the  producers&#8217; economies, which could mean there isn&#8217;t enough crude even when the trucking starts up again. But also, the refinery workers might  strike in sympathy with the truckers. But also, we don&#8217;t need as much  oil, because truckers aren&#8217;t consuming it. But also, we can&#8217;t run the  supertankers anymore because we don&#8217;t have enough oil to power them.</p><p>3. The way people react to a given problem is hard to distinguish  from the problem itself, and the overall fractally-complicated mess of  causes and effects depends equally on both of them. For example, the aliens might start out believing gas lines cause oil shortages, since  they always see them at the same time. Later, they might do a  time-series analysis and determine that gas lines are a consequence of oil shortages. But even this wouldn&#8217;t be quite accurate &#8211; gas lines are a  consequence of governments rationing gas in order to alleviate oil  shortages! If a laissez-faire government decides it&#8217;s not their  responsibility to ration gas, you could have an oil shortage with no gas  lines!</p><p>4. It&#8217;s very hard to determine the input or output of any given part  of the system, because everything tends toward homeostasis in hidden  ways. So for example, if a new and deadly coronavirus appears, it could spread and kill millions. But maybe nobody dies, because governments institute strict lockdowns. If strict lockdowns prevent  people from working, that should make them miss rent and get  evicted. But maybe nobody gets evicted, because the government increases taxes on the rich and gives the money to at-risk tenants. So death rates stay the same, but wealth inequality goes down. An alien scientist studying this system from orbit and noticing only a decrease in wealth inequality would have no way of concluding that a new and deadly disease was spreading. Everything has gone through too many steps to be legible.</p><p>5. If you zoom out, you can notice very broad patterns, but these  patterns are protean and never share exactly the same features. For  example, usually recessions have low inflation &#8211; but the 1970s recession  had high inflation instead. Usually recessions see capital and labor suffer alike &#8211; but the 2020 recession saw very high unemployment with only brief disruptions to the stock market. So you can have a rule of thumb like &#8220;recessions cause unemployment, inflation, and lower stock prices&#8221;,  but you should expect it to frequently be violated in ways you can&#8217;t  predict. Presumably if you knew enough about the cause of a recession  and the other things going on at the time (including what interventions  humans were using to fight the recession) you could predict this kind of  thing better. But even humans can&#8217;t do that, let alone aliens watching from above.</p><p>6. Interventions that help one recession will fail to help superficially similar recessions. Materializing 1 billion barrels of  crude oil on the White House lawn will help an oil shortage recession but not a coronavirus recession. In fact, it won&#8217;t even help every oil  shortage recession; an oil shortage recession caused by a strike at  refineries will resist treatment with crude oil. Even if you choose the exact right treatment, it might fail because of other variables you  didn&#8217;t consider. Materializing crude oil to treat a crude oil shortage  will fail if the government is too corrupt to distribute it effectively.  Or maybe the government tried to respond to the oil shortage by going  green, and now everything is in the middle of a difficult transition to  renewable energy, and so even though an oil shortage caused the recession, the economy can no longer benefit from increased oil.</p><p>7. Most interventions have unpredictable side effects. For example,  materializing thousands of hyperrefineries run by robots successfully solves recessions caused by shortage of refinery capacity. But it also puts tens of thousands of people out of work, and sometimes those people  vote the socialist party into power, and sometimes that causes a  recession even deeper than the original one they were trying to solve.</p><p>8. Almost any intervention can help or hurt a little, or sometimes both at once, often in completely unpredictable ways. For example, the  time the aliens created one million lions in the center of Times Square  was more of a test of the Materialization Ray than something they really expected to help, but this destroyed the city of New York, which hurt America&#8217;s bargaining position, which caused them to cave in to the  demands of Arab countries, which convinced the Arab countries to resume sending oil a little sooner. </p><p>The APA Meeting mostly appreciates these findings, but some lively discussion ensues on a few more controversial points:</p><p>Professor Zxyxon argues that their seemingly-successful treatments will have unexpected side effects. The more oil they materialize, the  more likely Earth&#8217;s native oil industry collapses &#8211; nobody will be willing to pay for oil produced the usual way when magic oil keeps  materializing from thin air. That means that as soon as the aliens stop materializing oil, Earth will go into withdrawal, finding itself with  much less oil than ever before, and suffering a catastrophic economic collapse. She suggests that either they avoid ever materializing oil at  all, or that they &#8220;taper&#8221; their oil shipments to give Earth&#8217;s economy a  chance to recover.</p><p>Dr. Grblex thinks that the aliens are wrong to focus so much on the &#8220;chemical imbalance&#8221; theory of recessions. Instead of attributing them to a shortage of oil, they should pay more attention to a history of  trauma. As evidence, he presents his alternative theory that the 1970s  recession was caused by traumatic memories of the various wars between Israel and the Arab countries, which led the Arabs to impose their oil embargo in the first place. Instead of materializing oil, they should  try to help the Arabs and Israelis overcome their past trauma, which would lead humanity to resume producing oil naturally.</p><p>Dr. Xjvar insists that &#8220;recession&#8221; is a natural part of the boom-bust  cycle, and that trying to treat it prevents human civilization from  growing. For example, an oil shortage might encourage them to develop  renewable energy, or a coronavirus epidemic might spur their investment  in biotechnology. He thinks that pathologizing recession stigmatizes human civilizations that don&#8217;t focus on economic growth &#8211; but there are  many other valuable things humans can focus on.</p><p>(if you&#8217;re seeing this in your mind&#8217;s eye, picture it all as being  underneath a giant solid-light hologram advertising Vraylar. Nowhere in the galaxy is safe from <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/22/the-apa-meeting-a-photo-essay/">the Vraylar ads</a>)</p><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>The global economy behaves like a huge dynamical system. Everything  affects everything else in so many different ways that it&#8217;s hard to keep  track of.</p><p>If aliens tried to model the economy the same way Borsboom et al are modeling the mind, they&#8217;d fail. They could pick ten important  economic indicators &#8211; maybe employment rate, the S&amp;P 500, inflation,  and a few other things &#8211; and track how they co-evolved over time. This  would probably be illuminating &#8211; for all I know some economist in our  world is doing it already and learning a lot. But it wouldn&#8217;t be enough. They would never  be able to predict a recession caused by conflict in the Middle East causing an oil embargo causing an energy shortage. Or a recession caused by deregulation of banks causing them to offer too many subprime loans causing all of them to go belly-up at once. They wouldn&#8217;t be  able to predict whether government policy would shorten a recession or make it worse, whether international trade could help prop up a  collapsing country or drag it further down. </p><p>At best they would sort of understand some of the principles behind  why this sort of thing is so hard. They could understand that recessions (and booms) are attractor states in a massively complex dynamical  system, and come up with vague principles about how that system responds  to certain shocks (eg &#8220;large stimulus packages can sometimes shift the  system from recession to normal growth&#8221;).</p><p>I think the mind is at least this complicated. Just to take one  especially well-understood example: some food includes vitamin B9. An  enzyme in your body called MTHFR helps change vitamin B9 into the active form  l-methylfolate. L-methylfolate helps a waste chemical in the body  called homocysteine turn into a helpful chemical called SAM-e, and  prevents another helpful chemical called tetrahydrobiopterin from  decomposing into a waste chemical called dihydrobiopterin. SAM-e and  tetrahydrobiopterin are cofactors for the enzymes tryptophan hydroxylase  and tyrosine hydroxylase, which change the amino acids tryptophan and  tyrosine into serotonin and dopamine, respectively. And serotonin and  dopamine are known to be heavily involved in mood and energy level. </p><p>Almost every step in this cycle is a potential depression treatment.  Studies support l-tryptophan, SAM-e, and l-methylfolate supplementation  as antidepressants (also, eating healthy in ways that get you more  vitamin B9). But each step regulates all of the other steps in complex  ways. For example, giving someone too much tyrosine might decrease the  levels of tryptophan in their brain, because these two amino acids  compete for a fixed number of transporters. The moral of the story isn&#8217;t  &#8220;SAM-e good, homocysteine bad&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;there&#8217;s a tendency for SAM-e to  be good and homocysteine bad, but either one could help or hurt  depending on how the system stabilizes after supplementation with either  changes the state of all the other variables&#8221;.</p><p>(It might sound like I&#8217;m hawking companies like <a href="https://geneticgenie.org/methylation-analysis/">Genetic Genie</a>  that try to measure exactly how much of each of these you have in your  body and tell you what your own personalized levels and deficiencies are. These companies would be great except for one thing: at present, we  don&#8217;t know enough to do this effectively, and they don&#8217;t work. Yes, that includes whichever really fancy new high-tech company with lots of  testimonials from hotshot doctors and professors is getting all the VC  money this year. If we ever get anything that works better than trial and error, I will let you know.)</p><p>And this is just one tiny part of your metabolism.

But many mental disorders evolve over time;  depression comes in discrete episodes that start at some point and get better at some other point; bipolar comes in patterned waves of mania, depression, and euthymia. To understand these conditions, we have to add a dynamical systems perspective and think of episodes as attractor states.</p><p>Some mental disorders are pure traits without much dynamism &#8211; I think  personality disorders, ADHD, and autism fall into this category.</p><p>Others are purely dynamical systems, where patients can sometimes be  perfectly healthy, but occasionally they shift into a different  attractor state. You could sort of think of this as having the &#8220;trait&#8221;  of a weirdly-shaped attractor basin if you want, but there&#8217;s still a clear distinction between health and disease. I think depression and  bipolar disorder fall into this category.</p><p>But most are combinations &#8211; patients have some consistent trait, but  also sometimes have &#8220;flare-ups&#8221; where the trait gets worse than usual,  or &#8220;good times&#8221; where the trait is better than usual. I think anxiety  disorders, panic disorder, and schizophrenia are like this. There&#8217;s also  a condition called &#8220;double depression&#8221;, which combines a constant  dysthymia with occasional more serious major depressive episodes &#8211; an  elegant demonstration of the complex relationship between trait-like and dynamical  disorders!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Riddle Of The Sphinx II: Sustained Release Riddlin']]></title><description><![CDATA[...]]></description><link>https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/riddle-of-the-sphinx-ii-sustained</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/riddle-of-the-sphinx-ii-sustained</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Alexander]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:39:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/853d9067-4b40-40e3-bc93-70c3d707fcd2_512x394.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was driving down to LA when the cops pulled me over.

They're a type of trustless, decentralized expertise that often equals or outperforms official sources. </p><p>But they're not quite the present. Right now I only know of three prediction markets, and none of them live up to their potential. As usual, it&#8217;s the government&#8217;s fault: betting on prediction markets is technically gambling, which makes it mostly illegal (of course, you can still buy all the Gamestop stock you want). </p><p>Each of the three big prediction markets tries to solve this in a different way.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.predictit.org/">PredictIt </a></strong>struck a special deal with the government where they can run a limited number of predictions as long as nobody is allowed to bet very much. They probably have the most users, but most of them are dumb money, and the restrictions prevent smart money from coming in and replacing them. Also, the market fritters away its limited number of predictions on dumb political horse race stuff. I think of this as a missed opportunity.</p><p><strong><a href="https://augur.net/">Augur </a></strong>is a decentralized Ethereum-based prediction market.  Since it's crypto, it ought to be able to violate laws with impunity, and in theory this should make it the leader of the pack. In practice it's either nonfunctional or so minimally functional as to be useless. The team involved seems pretty dedicated and competent, and I assume they have some good reason for pretending their product currently exists instead of replacing the whole thing with a COMING SOON banner. I hope this will one day be our savior. But like the real Messiah, it&#8217;s taking its sweet time.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/">Metaculus </a></strong>solves the regulatory problem by using fake Internet points instead of money. This is a disappointing solution; it limits the user base to Internet obsessives instead of (say) investment bankers. Still, there are a lot of Internet obsessives. And the team running it is really top-notch, interested in pushing the limits of what prediction markets can do, and trying to focus on some of the most important questions. </p><p>I want to raise awareness of prediction markets, and right now Metaculus seem like the best people to raise awareness of. So welcome to Metaculus Mondays, where I make you listen to reports of how the prediction markets did this week and what they're predicting for later.</p><p>This week: the coronavirus.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-176-996" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d5904cf-2d1d-4835-ab96-c974d43d24bb_996x176.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d5904cf-2d1d-4835-ab96-c974d43d24bb_996x176.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6d5904cf-2d1d-4835-ab96-c974d43d24bb_996x176.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:176,&quot;width&quot;:996,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:32735,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

The guesses started at about 500,000. But as cases rose further through December and January, the guesses rose too, until now they're averaging almost 690,000 people. </p><p>Right now 440,000 people have died, so Metaculus expects another 250,000. Right now 3,500 people die of COVID daily. If that death rate continued, we'd be past their estimate for December by April. But it's reasonable to expect deaths to decrease as winter turns to spring, more people get vaccinated, and the usual control system causing people to lock down tighter as deaths rise kicks in. Still, I notice that every day their estimate rises slightly. Seems suspicious. I'm betting my fake Internet points on something a little higher, maybe 750,000, with a long tail in case of variants that can reinfect the already infected, or if so many people refuse vaccination that we don't have herd immunity for the danger period in winter 2021.</p><p>Moving on:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-178-1029" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab7283b7-f54c-44c0-a165-b3ad29df103b_1029x178.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab7283b7-f54c-44c0-a165-b3ad29df103b_1029x178.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab7283b7-f54c-44c0-a165-b3ad29df103b_1029x178.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:178,&quot;width&quot;:1029,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27162,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

Metaculus seems to think we'll reach 50% by June. My main reason for pessimism is that only about 50% of Americans <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/poll-nearly-half-of-american-adults-now-want-the-covid-vaccine-asap/">really want the COVID vaccine immediately</a> - the rest say they'll "wait and see". Some of those people probably will be satisfied once there are no major side effects. Others will see COVID rates go down (as they inevitably will during the spring) and decide they don't need it. I don't think the average Metaculan truly understands the difficulty involved in getting random people to accept public health interventions in any situation other than "you will die IMMEDIATELY if you don't do this". And there's a wild card scenario where the virus mutates, the vaccine doesn't work as well, and people decide it's no longer worth it.</p><p>Next up:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-149-425" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5790733f-1ade-49cc-89bf-a06ca9fb9e29_425x149.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5790733f-1ade-49cc-89bf-a06ca9fb9e29_425x149.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5790733f-1ade-49cc-89bf-a06ca9fb9e29_425x149.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:149,&quot;width&quot;:425,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:10211,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

My understanding is that probably some new strains will have a 1% or 10% or whatever chance of infecting already-immune people - lower than infecting coronavirus-naive people, but still more than zero. If a strain that can infect immune people at a 1% rate infects 10 million (mostly non-immune) people, does that count? Since this question doesn't say, I don't think it's that meaningful. Which is too bad, because it's probably the most important question of 2021 and the one that should be getting the most attention right now.

Well, if we don't, an extra 50,000 people or so will die. You can do this with any question. How much will global temperatures increase if we (do/don't) rejoin the Paris Agreement? How much will British GDP be in 2025 if there (is/isn't) Brexit? How many people will get shot by cops next year if we (do/don't) go ahead with some defund-the-police plan? </p><p>We shouldn't be the sort of straw-man technocrats who unthinkingly choose the lowest number because Our Metrics Perfectly Capture Reality. But in this case I&#8217;m pretty okay with being the sort of technocrat who thinks about it for a second, remembers that the lower number represents 50,000 real breathing human beings who get to be alive instead of dead, and then goes with it.</p><p>(in the real world, we didn't do human challenge trials, 100K people have already died this year, and it's only February)</p><p>And finally, since you've been bearing with me so nicely, here's something a little on the lighter side, from <a href="https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7053/Who-will-win-the-2024-Republican-presidential-nomination">Predict</a><a href="https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7057/Who-will-win-the-2024-Democratic-presidential-nomination">It</a>:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-468-700" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17e17a3b-5400-43e0-a6a2-6ff88a68aeb2_700x468.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17e17a3b-5400-43e0-a6a2-6ff88a68aeb2_700x468.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/17e17a3b-5400-43e0-a6a2-6ff88a68aeb2_700x468.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:468,&quot;width&quot;:700,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:140096,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is even-numbered, so go wild. Otherwise, post about whatever you want. Also:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Thanks to everyone who commented on the amphetamines thread. The main things I learned: another way of thinking about the difference between racemic, d-, and meth- amphetamine is the <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/know-your-amphetamines#comment-1122928">ratio of central to peripheral effects</a>. One major reason druggies prefer methamphetamine to unsubstituted is because it&#8217;s <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/know-your-amphetamines#comment-1121820">easier to make</a>. I was wrong about Vyvanse; <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/know-your-amphetamines#comment-1120873">it gets cleaved by red blood cells</a>, not the liver. And one reader links me to this conspiracy theory (sorry, it&#8217;s actually very reasonable, I just can&#8217;t help thinking of it that way) that Vyvanse <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5594082/">doesn&#8217;t have superior pharmacokinetics to other amphetamines</a> at all, and it&#8217;s all just Dexedrine + hype; I haven&#8217;t had enough time to examine the theory in depth but am interested in people&#8217;s thoughts. </p><p><strong>2.</strong> On the Taxometrics post, most interesting comment was probably from Duncan, who argues that pedophilia might not be as taxonic as it appears - it&#8217;s just that you wouldn&#8217;t admit you&#8217;re a pedophile (or come to anyone&#8217;s attention as a pedophile) unless you have such a severe case that there&#8217;s no way for you to hide it. This made me think about how many of the supposedly-taxonic conditions were also unusually stigmatizing conditions; draw your own conclusions.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>And better late than never - I recently learned that one of the economists I cited on my wage stagnation post on Slate Star Codex (February 2019) chimed in with a great comment on explaining her work - you can <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/25/wage-stagnation-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/#comment-735076">read it here</a>.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Re: the series of Weyl posts - <a href="https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/641769028753522688/on-weyls-why-i-am-not-a-technocrat">nostalgebraist weighs in</a>.

There is a lot there to respond to and in general I  think the exchange speaks for itself. However, I think there are few  points where clarification is important for the exchange to be   productive, which I'll briefly address here. </p><p><strong>1. </strong>Let  me start with concessions. There are many points where @slatestarcodex  correctly highlights various areas where my grasp of beliefs and facts  are limited or wrong, especially in the depth of my grasp of the views  of the rationalist community. I freely admit that there are serious  limits to how much I've been able to research the views of people in  this community and I certainly hope they are not as I characterized  them, though as I will point out below many elements of Scott's response  confirm my concerns. </p><p><strong>2. </strong>Given the last point, I  fully acknowledge the danger of throwing stones lest I shatter my own  glass house. However, leaving aside any blame, I think to make sense of  my piece and Scott's response requires a bit of context that clearly he  lacked. First, outside some specific blog post I wrote, I am best known  as a mechanism designer. To cast me as a general opponent of technology  and mechanisms runs against literally everything I am known for and have  worked on my whole career. The piece was as much a self-critique and  caution about taking the sorts of work I do in the wrong, over-zealous  spirit as I had seen many in the rationalist community doing as anything  else. Second, if responding to anything directly, it was this review of  my book by <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191533">https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191533</a>  I think that piece perfectly exemplifies the spirit I am responding to  and critiquing. I think we need to avoid that spirit of mechanism  design.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Scott claims that critics of technocracy  always critique precisely the same examples. This is odd, given that my  essay  has several examples outside that cannon. Did Scott not see  these? I was blowing the whistle on one (<a href="https://promarket.org/2020/05/28/how-market-design-economists-engineered-economists-helped-design-a-mass-privatization-of-public-resources/">https://promarket.org/2020/05/28/how-market-design-economists-engineered-economists-helped-design-a-mass-privatization-of-public-resources/</a>) at roughly the same time I wrote the technocracy piece. These are  contemporary, not chestnuts, and conducted by precisely the circle (<a href="https://promarket.org/2020/05/28/how-market-design-economists-engineered-economists-helped-design-a-mass-privatization-of-public-resources/">https://promarket.org/2020/05/28/how-market-design-economists-engineered-economists-helped-design-a-mass-privatization-of-public-resources/</a>)whose condescending critiques of transparency and public engagement I was responding to.</p><p><strong>4.  </strong>Furthermore, the positive examples of technocracy @slatestarcodex  refers to are...surprising. Two examples. To call school desegregation a  technocratic invention papers over decades of community activism for  desegregation. Perhaps even more dramatically looking at the coronavirus  as an example of the success of technocracy runs against pretty much  any reasonable reading of the international data. Danielle Allen and I  have a piece coming out on this (we were both deeply involved in developing a response plan here <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/Covid-Roadmap">https://ethics.harvard.edu/Covid-Roadmap</a>   that significantly influenced now-President Biden's response), but  perhaps the sharpest point here is that the country, Taiwan, which  performed best in the virus was led in part by Audrey Tang who moved  back to Taiwan after being immersed in and repulsed by the rationalist  movement in Silicon Valley - see e.g. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-taiwans-unlikely-digital-minister-hacked-the-pandemic/">https://www.wired.com/story/how-taiwans-unlikely-digital-minister-hacked-the-pandemic/</a>) and dedicated herself to doing things differently in Taiwan (see her amazing poetic job description here: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/audreyt/status/767953441746411524&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;My <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>#OSOSNZ</span> prayer.

I find it hard to understand how one could see  the piece as opposed to mechanisms. My argument was that the appropriate  way for mechanisms to be adopted is through public  communication across lines of difference and in different value  systems/communicative modes. One thing I find striking in the history of  technology is that the vast majority of technologies that are actually  useful today were pioneered by people who had similar critiques to mine  here of technocracy, while those who zealous defend technocratic  approaches have generally either not themselves actually developed  successful technologies or have great technological dreams that have  generally led to poor social outcomes.  Consider Douglas Engelbart,  Norbert Wiener, Jaron Lanier, etc. Calling people like this, most of  whom were not even willing to express their views in the rationalistic  terms I wrote in, "anti-technology" redefines technology to be only  rigid and inhuman systems that fail.  The process of socio-technological  change has a far greater element of the "socio" when it succeeds than  those focused on autonomous "technology" allow. Communication and  collaboration outside of affordances of the technology itself are always  critical to success.  See, for example, Don Norman's Design of Everyday  Things, or anything else in the field of human-centered design. </p><p><strong>6.  </strong>I think @slatestarcodex's insistence on breaking apart mechanisms v.  judgement from top-down v. bottom-up misses a key part of the argument  and of what sociologists of science have long said. There is no unitary  thing called "science" or "mechanism". There are a variety of  disciplines of information processing across academic fields, across  cultures, across communities with in a culture, etc. "Mechanism" is just  how one group of people seeks to claim that their mode of reasoning is  uniquely unbiased and unaccountable to other ways of processing  information. It is precisely this move, the unwillingness to think,  speak or justify oneself on terms acceptable to those who think  differently from you, that his response manifests and that concerns me. </p><p><strong>7.  </strong>A particularly striking example of this was his identification of  "democracy" with the one-person-one-vote rule, an identification I have  in the past been guilty of (hence the self-critique). This is not  coterminal with what democracy means to most people, nor how most political  scientists think of it. I will not belabor this here, but I think it is  a nice illustration of how much one's views can be narrowed by only  looking through a "mechanistic" lens. </p><p><strong>8. </strong>On the AI stuff, more here (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-is-an-ideology-not-a-technology/">https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-is-an-ideology-not-a-technology/</a>) and much more coming soon in a paper I am writing with Divya Siddarth</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Contra Weyl On Technocracy]]></title><description><![CDATA[Beyond Brasilia]]></description><link>https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/contra-weyl-on-technocracy</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/contra-weyl-on-technocracy</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Alexander]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 04:15:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e9fd16b9-48ca-4b94-b003-17700c180eb6_2836x768.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>I am not defending technocracy. </p><p>Nobody ever defends technocracy. It's like "elitism" or "statism". There is no Statist Party. Nobody holds rallies demanding more statism. There is no Citizens for Statism Facebook page with thousands of likes and followers. Yet for some reason libertarians don't win every single national election. Strange, isn't it?</p><p>Maybe it&#8217;s one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_conjugation">Russell conjugations</a> - "I am firm, you are obstinate". I support rule of law, you're a statist. I want checks and balances on mob rule, you're an elitist. I like evidence-based policy, you're a technocrat.</p><p>I am not defending technocracy. But I do like evidence-based policy. So I read with interest Glen Weyl's <a href="https://radicalxchange.org/blog/posts/2019-08-19-bv61r6/">Why I Am Not A Technocrat</a>. It starts with a short summary of <em>Seeing Like A State</em>. It ties this into modern "evidence-based policy" and "mechanism design". It talks about how technocrats will always have their own insular culture and biases and paradigms, which prevent them from seeing the real world in its full complexity. Therefore, we should be careful about supposedly "objective" policies, and make sure they are always heavily informed by real people's real knowledge. Then it draws on vague rumors of the "rationalist community" and a shadowy figure named "Eliezer Yudkowsky" to create a completely fictional reimagination of us as a group of benighted people who don't understand any of these things, and just go around saying "hurr durr top-down systems are great, no way there could possibly be anything our models don't capture."</p><p>I like <em>Seeing Like A State</em> as much as anyone else (though see the caveats in Part VII of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/">my review</a> for some criticisms). But it worries me that everyone analyzes the exact same three examples of the failures of top-down planning: Soviet collective farms, Brasilia, and Robert Moses. I&#8217;d like to propose some other case studies:</p><p><strong>1. Mandatory vaccinations:</strong> Technocrats used complicated mathematical models to determine that mass vaccination would create a "herd immunity" to disease. Certain that their models were "objectively" correct and so could not possibly be flawed, these elites decided to force vaccines on a hostile population. Despite popular protest (did you know that in 1800s England, <a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/history-anti-vaccination-movements">anti-smallpox-vaccine rallies</a> attracted tens of thousands of demonstrators?), these technocrats continued to want to "arrogantly remake the world in their image," and pushed ahead with their plan, ignoring normal citizens' warnings that their policies might have unintended consequences, like causing autism.</p><p><strong>2. School desegregation:</strong> Nine unelected experts with Harvard and Yale degrees, using a bunch of Latin terms like <em>a certiori</em> and <em>de facto</em> that ordinary people could not understand let alone criticize, decided to completely upend the traditional education system of thousands of small communities to make it better conform to some rules written in a two-hundred-year-old document. The communities themselves opposed it strongly enough to offer violent resistance, but the technocrats steamrolled over all objections and sent in the National Guard to enforce their orders.</p><p><strong>3. The interstate highway system:</strong> 1950s army bureaucrats with a Prussia fetish decided America needed its own equivalent of the Reichsautobahn. The federal government came up with a Robert-Moses-like plan to spend $114 billion over several decades to build a rectangular grid of numbered giant roads all up and down the country, literally paving over whatever was there before, all according to pre-agreed federal standards. The public had so little say in the process that they started hundreds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_revolts_in_the_United_States">freeway revolts</a> trying to organize to prevent freeways from being built through their cities; the government crushed these when it could, and relocated the freeways to less politically influential areas when it couldn't.</p><p><strong>4. Climate change:</strong> In the second half of the 20th century, scientists determined that carbon dioxide emissions were raising global temperatures, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Climatologists created complicated formal models to determine how quickly global temperatures might rise, and economists designed clever from-first-principle mechanisms that could reduce emissions, like cap-and-trade systems and carbon taxes. But these people were members of the elite toying with equations that could not possibly include all the relevant factors, and who were vulnerable to their elite biases. So the United States decided to leave the decision up to democratic mechanisms, which allowed people to contribute "outside-the-system" insights like "Actually global warming is fake and it's all a Chinese plot".</p><p><strong>5. Coronavirus lockdowns:</strong> The government appointed a set of supposedly infallible scientist-priests to determine when people were or weren't allowed to engage in normal economic activity. The scientist-priests, who knew nothing about the complex set of factors that make one person decide to go to a rock festival and another to a bar, decided that vast swathes of economic activity they didn't understand must stop. The ordinary people affected tried to engage in the usual mechanisms of democracy, like complaining, holding protests, and plotting to kidnap their governors - but the scientist-priests, certain that their analyses were "objective" and "fact-based", thought ordinary people couldn't possibly be smart enough to challenge them, and so refused to budge.</p><p>Nobody uses the word "technocrat" except when they're criticizing something. So "technocracy" accretes this entire language around it - unintended consequences, the perils of supposed "objectivity", the biases inherent in elite paradigms. And then when you describe something using this language, it's like "Oh, of course that's going to fail - everything like that has always failed before!"</p><p>But if you accept that "technocracy" describes things other than Soviet farming, Brasilia, and Robert Moses, the trick stops working. You notice a lot of things you could describe using the same vocabulary were good decisions that went well. Then you have to ask yourself: is <em>Seeing Like A State</em> the definitive proof that technocratic schemes never work? Or is it a compendium of rare man-bites-dog style cases, interesting precisely because of how unusual they are?</p><p>I want to make it really clear that I'm not saying that technocracy is good and democracy is bad. I'm saying that <em>this is actually a hard problem</em>. It's not a morality play, where you tell ghost stories about scary High Modernists, point vaguely in the direction of Brasilia, say some platitudes about how no system can ever be truly unbiased, and then your work is done. There are actually a bunch of complicated reasons why formal expertise might be more useful in some situations, and local knowledge might be more useful in others.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Weyl starts by defining technocracy:</p><blockquote><p>By technocracy, I mean the view that most of governance and policy should be left to some type of &#8220;experts&#8221;, distinguished by meritocratically-evaluated training in formal methods used to &#8220;optimize&#8221; social outcomes...perhaps the most prominent version, especially in democratic countries, is a belief in a technocracy based on a mixture of analytic philosophy, economic theory, computational power and high-volume statistical analysis, often using experimentation. This form of technocracy is a widely held view among much of the academic and high technology elites, among the most powerful groups in the world today. I focus on this tendency as I assume it will be the form of technocracy most familiar and attractive to my readers</p></blockquote><p>Did you notice none of Weyl's examples of technocracy fit this definition at all? Robert Moses had zero formal training in urban planning or anything related to city-building. The Soviet leadership wasn't "meritocratically chosen". And Oscar Niemeyer didn't construct a High Modernist planned village and a control village, test which one performed better on various metrics, and scale the winner up into Brasilia. </p><p>(I'm not saying it would necessarily have gone well if he did - maybe the principles don't scale, or maybe he would have chosen the wrong metrics, or maybe any of a thousand other things could have gone wrong. But it would have been <em>better than what he actually tried</em>, which was to take some weird aesthetic choices by Le Corbusier and follow them off a cliff. Weyl takes exactly the thing Niemeyer didn't do, then uses the failure of his project to argue that doing it is bad!)</p><p>I think Weyl's idea of "technocracy" is incoherent because he's trying to combine several different axes into one word. Some of these might be:</p><p><strong>1. Top-down intervention vs. bottom-up evolution</strong>. Did a system evolve on its own in a emergent way? Or is some planner coming up with the shape beforehand and ordering it to be enacted? To some degree bottom-up evolution makes the other axes irrelevant - "technocracy" and "democracy" are both forms of government, and if the government's not intervening then there's no question about who decides what form the intervention takes.</p><p><strong>2. Mechanism vs. judgment</strong>. Is the system determined by some sort of algorithmic mechanism, like "We'll enact whichever plan ends up with the highest price in our prediction market" / "Our school will admit whoever scores highest on the admission exam"? Or does it rely on human judgment, ie "We'll enact whichever plan our assembly reaches consensus around" / "Our school will admit whoever holistically seems to match our values the best"?</p><p><strong>3. Autarchy vs. democracy. </strong>This is obviously a spectrum, since even the most totalitarian dictator has a few advisors, and even the most democratic country still has presidents and prime ministers. But it seems fair to say Robert Moses was less democratic than some more touchy-feely city planner, so sure.</p><p><strong>4. Expert opinion vs. popular opinion. </strong>Again, obviously a spectrum. There are subquestions here where nobody disagrees - shouldn't there be some doctors and epidemiologists at the FDA and WHO? But I think it's fair to say that there's a distinction between a country where doctors and epidemiologists can unilaterally ban cigarettes vs. one where that decision is made at a more democratic level.</p><p><strong>5. Victims ignored vs. victims consulted. </strong>This is slightly different from the expert vs. popular axis, in that a plan to regulate farmers might be popular among the masses but not incorporate advice from or opinions from farmers themselves. Weyl makes a big deal about whether planners seek democratic feedback, but I am suspicious of how much this really varies. Suppose you're the FDA trying to regulate cigarettes, and your doctors and bureaucrats have come up with a plan. What do you do now to "seek democratic feedback"? Put a suggestion box outside the FDA office? Invite randomly selected smokers to FDA headquarters to tell you what they think? Just assume that, since elected officials appointed the FDA director, you're okay?</p><p>These axes prove their use when we use them to analyze Weyl's vs. Scott's conceptions of "legibility". The two use the word in exact opposite ways; Weyl is interested in whether technocrats' plans are legible to the populace; Scott is interested in whether the populace's activities are legible to technocrats. Weyl claims that technocrats' plans are hard for the masses to understand. Scott thinks exactly the opposite: when Oscar Niemeyer says "let's build giant apartment buildings separated by a rectangular grid of roads", he can easily list the advantages - short commutes, speedy traffic, impossible to get lost. It's only the disadvantages - "it wouldn't feel like <em>home</em>", "I kind of like being in crowds sometimes" - that are hard to express. The advantages of collective farming are obvious: specialize in one crop, gains from working together instead of competing with each other, use the most advanced industrial farming techniques. The disadvantages are so arcane that you would have to be a farmer yourself with complicated agricultural craft to understand them.  The technocrats can always point to X% GDP increases, Y extra jobs, and the like; the masses are stuck saying "It doesn't feel right". </p><p>I think what's going on here is that Scott is almost uniquely focusing on the bottom-up vs. top-down axis; he thinks top-down plans are legible and bottom-up plans aren't, and he calls the former "technocracy". Weyl doesn't care at all about this axis; he seems to be assuming top-down intervention will happen, and talking about what kind of top-down intervention (in terms of the other four axes) we're going to get. As a result, the two of them talk past each other in a bizarre way.</p><p>In another case, Weyl critiques neoreaction while accidentally parroting its talking points; <a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2009/05/futarchy-considered-retarded/">this foundational neoreactionary essay</a> is spookily similar to Weyl's own. This is because both Weyl and the neoreactionaries agree profoundly on taking the judgment side of the judgment vs. mechanism axis, but disagree on the autarchy vs. democracy one.</p><p>I find Axes 1, 3, 4, and 5 kind of boring once we take the time to decompose them. Everybody's already argued the merits of government intervention vs. libertarianism, of populism vs. elitism, etc. Weyl seems to have a special interest in Axis 2 - mechanism vs. human judgment - and I think this is the most interesting potential point of disagreement.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>From Weyl:</p><blockquote><p>In short, we are very far from discovering formalisms capable of capturing and quantifying most of the critical inputs to policy and systems design for a decent society. So much of what we still need lives in e.g. the low-income housing developments, the lived experiences of workers facing powerful corporations, the NGOs on the ground in Myanmar, and the community educational justice groups. To the extent that technocracy is a practice of insulating policy makers and system designers from the need to justify themselves in the language of, clearly explain their designs to and maintain open lines of communication from these highly informative channels, it leads to large-scale failures, corruption, crises and justified political backlash and outrage.</p></blockquote><p>Why would anyone ever want mechanism? Why would we want to use formalisms? Human decision-making is so versatile and so good at taking account of outside-the-system problems that limiting ourselves to mechanical models would pointlessly cripple us, right?</p><p>I'm a fan of doing things formally. My answer to the above challenge is: mechanism is constraining on purpose. It's constraining in the same sense that tying yourself to the mast so that Sirens don't lure you to a watery doom is constraining. Mathematical formalism is a trick for securing a system against bias and corruption. Let me give four examples:</p><p><strong>1. Mechanical district creation:</strong> Mathematicians have developed various ways of automatically creating Congressional districts, usually something like "tile the state with compact polygons". Maybe this is inferior to having wise people who truly understand the state and its complex needs draw districts that group naturally-related areas together and make sure everyone has an equal say. But somehow whenever we ask our wise-people-who-truly-understand-the-state to do this, they always come up with weird pipe-cleaner shapes that vote exactly 51% Republican. I admit there are many ways to solve this besides tiling the state with compact polygons. But if we can't make any of the other ones work, tiling the state with compact polygons would beat how we do things now.</p><p><strong>2. Aptitude-test-based admissions to colleges:</strong> This is how most countries other than the US do things. But 1920s deans realized this let in too many Jews, so they changed it to a holistic admissions process where wise representatives of our cultural values holistically scanned the good and bad aspects of every applicant. In the past, this system was a fig leaf for excluding Jews; today, it's a fig leaf for excluding Asians, and for letting people whose parents donate lots of money get in through the back door. This isn't just true for colleges - we know that giving everyone IQ tests and letting the top scorers into gifted programs ends up with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5137751/">better representation of gifted minorities</a> than letting teachers use their judgment. One of the most infuriating parts of Weyl's essay is where he talks about how technocracy is bad because it can incorporate subtly racist assumptions into its equations - as if asking random people to make subjective decisions is safer from that failure mode!</p><p><strong>3. Housing:</strong> I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where digging up Robert Moses' corpse and appointing it Perpetual Planning Czar would be way better than what we have now. It turns out when you carefully seek democratic feedback on planning decisions, the feedback is usually "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY#BANANA_and_CAVE">build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything</a>", nothing ever gets built, and your city ends up in a terrible housing crisis with lots of people being broke, homeless, and miserable. One of the most exciting plans to solve the NIMBY crisis is <a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2019/5/16/18617019/transit-housing-bill-sb-50-approproations-committee-suspense-wiener">SB50</a>, a bill that ennumerates mechanical restrictions on how all zoning decisions have to go, and deliberately blocks affected neighbors from having any say in the process.</p><p><strong>4. Democracy:</strong> For all the supposed opposition of technocracy and democracy, it's worth noting that democratic elections are an example of mechanism in action. Instead of having to come to a consensus on difficult questions, we just compare two numbers - the number of people who vote for the decision, and the number who vote against it - and whichever number is bigger wins. Can you imagine if instead we had to actually figure out what was good? Or if instead of using numbers, we tried to judge the subjective quality of a coalition - this side has more PhDs, but that one has more army veterans? It would end in civil war or dictatorship within a week. It's only the stark quantitative nature of elections that makes them hard to bias or hack.</p><p>In each case, we don't trust any individual human to make an unbiased decision. So we design some mechanism that's as unbiased as possible, and give it to lots of people so they can check that it's unbiased (in a way that you can never check whether someone's intuition is unbiased). Then we make decisions via the mechanism.</p><p>In a perfect world, we wouldn't have to do this. In the real world, well - have you heard the story of statistical prediction rules in medicine? I&#822;t&#822;'&#822;s&#822; &#822;n&#822;o&#822;t&#822; &#822;a&#822; &#822;s&#822;t&#822;o&#822;r&#822;y&#822; &#822;t&#822;h&#822;e&#822; &#822;J&#822;e&#822;d&#822;i&#822; &#822;w&#822;o&#822;u&#822;l&#822;d&#822; &#822;t&#822;e&#822;l&#822;l&#822; &#822;y&#822;o&#822;u&#822;.&#822;  Some people analyzed a bunch of data, came up with an algorithm for diagnosing heart attacks, and told doctors they should use the algorithm instead of their own judgment. Everyone who hears this story expects the moral to be that no amount of "smartest guy in the room" data-crunching can match the holistic experience of trained doctors with years of domain experience - but in fact <a href="http://meehl.umn.edu/sites/meehl.dl.umn.edu/files/138cstixdawesfaustmeehl.pdf">the algorithms won hands-down</a>. The interesting part (search "Goldberg Rule" in that link) is what happens when you give doctors an algorithm and tell them to use it to supplement their judgment. This doctor-algorithm team usually <em>still</em> does worse than the algorithm alone. And if you explain this to the doctor - say "I know you think you're going to outperform the algorithm, but actually doctor-algorithm teams usually lose to the algorithm alone, so you're probably better off just sticking the algorithm unless you're <em>really </em>sure you have some special knowledge" - the algorithm <em>still</em> wins. In this case, supplementing the technocratic method with human judgment just plain worsens the technocratic method. I don't know if this carries over to more society-relevant decisions, but it's the sort of thing you have to consider. </p><p>The people who devise mechanisms can sometimes be biased. But they can't apply their biases very accurately. Perhaps the decision to make Congressional districts compact hexagons instead of compact pentagons might very subtly favor Republicans in some way. But it would favor Republicans less than getting a bunch of Republicans together to draw every district in exactly the way that favors Republicans the most; there's a limit to how biased a short hexagon-drawing algorithm can get. Likewise, if you wanted to bias a college admissions algorithm against Asians, you could perhaps weight math test scores a bit lower than English test scores. But that would bias it less than just having some guy who can look at Asian applicants and say "Nope, not him". Also, mechanisms are transparent and can be inspected. The entire country could turn its scrutiny on the decision to weight math tests less in the algorithm - whereas if you're just using "human judgment", each particular example of the admissions officer rejecting an Asian will pass unknown to anyone but the candidate involved.</p><p>This isn't trying to say mechanism is always good and judgment is always bad! We can predict cases where one might be better than the other - and as with the doctor studies and the gifted program studies, we can test when one is better than the other. I'm just trying to say it's an interesting question that you can't resolve just by throwing a copy of <em>Seeing Like A State</em> at someone.</p><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>I want to briefly respond to Weyl's critique of rationality and effective altruism:</p><blockquote><p>The effective altruism movement, which largely grew directly out of the rationalist movement, seeks to maximize the efficacy with which charitable donations are directed using standard rationalist methods. It is a tight-knit community that strongly privileges rationalist approaches over all other forms of knowledge-making (such as from the humanities, continental philosophy, or humanistic social sciences) and tends to dismiss input not formulated in rationalist terms. The community also has a strong and explicitly stated view that its activities uniquely contribute to the achievement of &#8220;the good&#8221;: of their top five recommendations of most productive careers by a leading community organization, two suggest being a researcher or support staff within the movement, and two others recommend working on the AI alignment problem (see the next point). Until recently, much of the analysis and funding emerging from the community has pointed towards a focus on extremely unlikely but potentially catastrophic risks, such as alien, asteroid or biological catastrophes.</p></blockquote><p>Weyl wrote this essay a few months before COVID, so his pooh-poohing of the idea that there might be a biological catastrophe is an unfortunate anachronism. But I think it's important to note that we got this right (and he got it wrong) precisely because we "privilege rationalist approaches over all other forms of knowledge-making". People <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/01/book-review-the-precipice/">like Toby Ord</a> tried to calculate the risk of every kind of disaster and how bad it would be - and at the same time Weyl was making fun of us for caring about biological catastrophes, Ord was writing about how the numbers suggested zoonotic diseases from bats could cause catastrophic pandemics. This kind of work ultimately led to EA flagship group Open Philanthropy Project spending almost $50 million on its <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/biosecurity">Biosecurity And Pandemic Preparedness Program</a> between 2014 and 2019; if other people had taken a few minutes to read our arguments instead of chiding us for how naive it is to prioritize things based on rational methods, maybe the world would have been more prepared.</p><p>Trying to be charitable to Weyl, I think he's thinking of the EA movement as trying to perfectly quantify exactly how many lives can be saved per dollar, then following that number off a cliff. I can see how a ten-minute scan of the movement could get that impression, but I think even a thirty-minute one would correct the misimpression. EA does the quantification <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/">as a guide to other forms of reasoning</a>. There is no way to perfectly calculate the devastation of a potential pandemic that hasn't happened yet. But once you make even a weak effort, you notice that all the numbers are really really big. And once you make an effort to quantify the importance of the <em>cause du jour</em> supported by the humanities and continental philosophy, sometimes you notice that under every set of reasonable assumptions it's smaller than the other number. And of course you supplement this with lots of trying to understand the complicated unquantifiable issues involved - under no circumstance do you skip that step - but you're just trying to do an analysis that has <em>some</em> contact with some reality-based number and isn't <em>entirely</em> dependent on the popular mood about something. I think this successfully achieves the difficult balance between model-laden technicalities and messy real life, and whatever form of reasoning Weyl was using to let him dismiss biological risks without doing any modeling failed to achieve that balance.</p><p>(maybe this is a <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/09/all-debates-are-bravery-debates/">bravery debate</a> - I believe almost everyone is using fuzzy human judgment and guidance from the humanities to decide how to best improve the world, and injecting a little bit of science is a powerful innovation. If Weyl believes the opposite, then it would make sense for him to recommend the injection of a little more human judgment - although then he would have to explain how so many amazing-by-rational-standards charities were underfunded before EA came along, and how many useless-by-rational-standards ones were rolling in money.)</p><p>Moving on:</p><blockquote><p>Yet, interestingly, the conclusions of the analysis emerging from the community increasingly undermine these foci and the approach of the community more broadly. In particular, <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/">recent research</a> in the community suggests that the greatest and most probable risks to be avoided are anthropogenic (climate change, nuclear war, the rise of a totalitarian regime, other environmental catastrophes etc.). Leaders in the community have in turn suggested that the most effective ways to avoid these are likely finding solutions to problems of political organization and legitimacy of social systems to help reduce the likelihood of conflict or inability to cooperate in the provision of critical global public goods.</p></blockquote><p>Weyl's link doesn't support his claim. It's an 80,000 Hours page saying that that it's important to protect the long-term future, something EA has believed since the beginning. EA started with a sort of merger and cross-pollination between people trying to save lives by eg curing malaria, and transhumanist/singularitarian groups working on protecting the long-term future; it held together because both groups agree that the other's position can make sense given different sets of complicated assumptions about ethics and tractability. The page Weyl links highlights and explains the philosophy around that, but does not claim anyone had a sudden enlightenment where they realized they'd previously been ignoring the threat of totalitarianism and that was wrong. Everyone has always believed that stopping the rise of a totalitarian regime is one part of the important task of protecting the far-future, but we haven't focused on it because it's less tractable and less neglected than other parts. As far as I know we continue to think that and mostly not focus on it aside from occasionally looking for tractable interventions we've missed.</p><p>All of this is too bad, because if Weyl was right, that would be a huge point in favor of rational methods. Imagine pointing to a community that did something wrong for years, then learned that thing was wrong, then admitted it and changed - and imagine thinking of it as a strike against that community's methods!</p><blockquote><p>Worse, the extremely elitist, segregated, and condescending approach to philanthropy encouraged by the community has created <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Winners-Take-All-Charade-Changing/dp/0451493249">widespread public backlash</a> that has closely tracked a broader populist reaction to technologically-driven globalist elites and that increasingly seems to be one of the largest risk factors for precisely the sorts of catastrophes effective altruists increasingly see as the largest threats to their long-term viewpoint on universal welfare. In short, it increasingly seems like, after almost a decade of existence, a primary conclusion of the movement&#8217;s analysis may be that the movement itself is a significant part of the problem it is identifying. Earlier, more open dialog with a broader range of approaches and social classes might have illuminated this more quickly and avoided the associated waste of talent and resources, two things the movement greatly prizes.</p></blockquote><p>Actually, most of the complaints I've heard have been from people like Weyl (Princeton PhD, Harvard postdoc, Principal Researcher at Microsoft New England). The &#8220;widespread public backlash&#8221; link goes to a book by Anand Giridharadas (Harvard PhD student, former McKinsey consultant, <em>New York Times</em> columnist). The actual normal people I talk to are broadly supportive. Some of my blog commenters are populist Trump supporters, and although they sometimes tell me I'm crazy for donating my money the way I do, they accept I have the right to spend it how I want and don't bother me much about it.</p><p>I worry that Weyl is kind of cargo-culting a response to populism, a sort of "The masses hate science and reason and improving things, right? So maybe if we never do any of that stuff then they'll let us live". This hasn't been my experience of the masses. My experience has been they hate elites trying to lecture them on what to do, especially if justified in pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo that they can see through easily.  </p><p>So, people who want to donate their own money according to their own understanding about what the best causes are is fine. Bill Gates isn't officially affiliated with the EA movement, but he's a broadly-aligned role model who donates to the same causes EAs do using the same data-based methods. Last time anyone checked, Gates had an approval rating of 76%, the <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/favorables/major_political_figures">second-highest of any figure asked about</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/07/only-half-americans-approve-gods-job-performance/353141/">literally higher than God</a>. I don&#8217;t think Gates should be considered a backlash-inducing failure.</p><p>And would Weyl's suggestions really help prevent populist backlashes? He wishes we abandoned our overly-rational ways in favor of "humanities, Continental philosophy, and the humanistic social sciences" - isn't that usually code for stuff like queer theory, postcolonial theory, and postmodernism? Are working-class Trump supporters really banging on their keyboards when they read about effective altruism, shouting "YOU NEED TO STOP TRYING TO BE OBJECTIVE AND FACT-BASED, AND BE MORE OPEN TO INSIGHTS FROM QUEER THEORY AND POSTMODERNISM"?</p><p>This doesn't necessarily mean those things are bad - populaces can backlash against all sorts of good things; maybe these fields have potentially valuable insights. But I don't think it's fair to demand other people optimize their philosophy to avoid completely hypothetical populist backlashes, while you're saying the most tone-deaf populist-backlash-provoking stuff imaginable. I am a member of the populace and I am so backlashed about Weyl's suggestions that I wrote this whole essay just to argue how wrong they were.</p><p>The section on AI is much worse than this, and I think it would be kinder to everyone involved to just pass over it entirely.</p><p>I continue to appreciate <em>Seeing Like A State</em>'s critique of...the thing it critiques, which is somewhat but not exactly similar to our word "technocracy". I think it's important to internalize that critique. But I think internalizing it is different from making it your One Hedgehog Tool that applies to everything everywhere. There are separate critiques of top-down intervention, mechanistic decision-making, autocracy, expert opinions, and lack of bottom-up feedback. All of those critiques are important - and all of them are matched by equally important reasons why sometimes you would want to use those things to some degree.</p><p>I think it's important not to collapse everything into just "technocracy bad, details to be provided later". You can't just present Brasilia and use that as an argument against randomized controlled trials! You can't just argue that forced collectivization of farms caused famines, therefore people shouldn't voluntarily assess where to donate their charity money to best meet their own goals! Maybe I'm being too technocratic here, but at some point you need to break things down, look at this (social) scientifically, and try to figure out which parts of things are consistently bad and which parts sometimes seem to help.</p><p>I think the rationalist and EA communities have been working on the project of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/07/yes-we-have-noticed-the-skulls/">trying to develop</a> the <em>metis</em> of balancing all of this correctly, and I continue to be optimistic about our progress on that front.<br><br><strong>EDIT: </strong>See Glen Weyl&#8217;s response <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/weyl-contra-me-on-technocracy">here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ontology Of Psychiatric Conditions: Taxometrics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Is mental illness a thing?

Not a lot of subtletly here. If we used some other graphable variable &#8211;  height, lifespan, IQ &#8211; we&#8217;d probably get something similar.</p><p>Maybe the biggest rabbit in the world is bigger than the  smallest human. That doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not two obvious categories.  It just means they&#8217;re two obvious categories with a tiny overlap. It  happens. </p><p>If we wanted to be clever, we could create a multivariate  distance measure that combines weight, height, lifespan, IQ, and lots of  other ways humans and rabbits could differ, into a 0 &#8211; 1 variable where  0 is &#8220;most rabbity&#8221; and 1 is &#8220;most humanish&#8221;. Probably these scores  wouldn&#8217;t overlap at all &#8211; if they did, it would mean there&#8217;s some human  who&#8217;s more like a rabbit than some rabbit is, which would be pretty  surprising. But even if this were true, it wouldn&#8217;t change the  fundamental finding that humans and rabbits are pretty different.

If we tried to just  eyeball the distribution of answers on a flu-symptom-questionnaire, we  would end up pretty doubtful that the flu was a real thing. Add in the  inevitable measurement error, and this just isn&#8217;t going to be helpful.</p><p>So actual taxometricians use more complicated statistical methods. Theodore Beauchaine describes three of them <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710982/">here</a>, of which I&#8217;ll try to very briefly explain one of the simplest, MAXCOV.</p><p>Suppose a category is real and involves at least three correlated  traits. For example, human vs. rabbit involves weight, lifespan, and IQ;  healthy vs. flu involves cough, fever, and muscle pain. Pick one trait &#8211;  let&#8217;s say cough. If the flu is a real category, then as we go from  lowest-cough-level to highest-cough-level, the people we&#8217;re looking at  should gradually go from mostly-not-having-the-flu to 50-50 to  mostly-having-the-flu.</p><p>In a a group of people who are 100% healthy, 0% flu, fever and muscle  pain should correlate at some level. In a group of people who are 0%  healthy, 100% flu, fever and muscle pain should correlate at some other  level. In a group that&#8217;s 50-50, the correlation should be higher than  either of these! That&#8217;s because level of fever gives you a clue to who  has the flu, which in turn gives you a clue about who has muscle pain.  In both the 100-0 and 0-100 groups, level of fever doesn&#8217;t tell you  anything about who has the flu (everyone has the same flu status), so  the existence of flu doesn&#8217;t give you any useful information. That means  that if a categorical difference exists, you should expect the  correlation between fever and muscle pain to peak at the level of cough  that most effectively divides flu patients from non-flu patients.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-630-450" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff89c6639-5c14-4014-9ad3-815d6c4a4d23_450x630.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff89c6639-5c14-4014-9ad3-815d6c4a4d23_450x630.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f89c6639-5c14-4014-9ad3-815d6c4a4d23_450x630.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:630,&quot;width&quot;:450,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

The first  graph depicts an objectively-existing-categorical depression that works  like species or influenza. As you increase the level of one depression  symptom (unintended  weight loss), the correlation between two other  depression symptoms (early morning awakening and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_retardation">psychomotor retardation</a>)  gradually goes up, peaks at 14, and then starts going down. This  suggests that in this case, depression is a real category, like the flu,  and the best cutoff to separate depressed from non-depressed people is  at 14 of whatever this variable is.</p><p>The second graph depicts a dimensional depression that works like  height or wealth. As you increase the level of one depression symptom  (insomnia), the correlation between other depression symptoms (sadness  and crying) stays about the same. This seems a bit off to me &#8211; sadness  and crying seem like a uniquely bad pair of symptoms to theorize are  correlated mostly because of the construct of depression &#8211; but whatever,  it&#8217;s just an example.</p><p>Clear as mud? Don&#8217;t worry, this isn&#8217;t really what most taxometricians  use. They use things that are much more complicated. Any  statisticians reading this might enjoy this paper on <a href="https://ruscio.pages.tcnj.edu/files/2018/06/Ruscio-et-al-2018-PA-CCFI.pdf">using the comparison curve fit index in taxometric analyses</a>; no guarantees about anyone else.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>In the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710982/">Brief Taxometrics Primer</a>  I&#8217;ve been trying to loosely follow in this post, Beauchaine strongly  suggests, though doesn&#8217;t say outright, that most psychiatric disorders  are dimensional, like height and wealth. But a few may be objective  distinct categories, especially schizophrenia, narcissistic personality,  and endogenous depression (a subtype of depression that happens for no reason, as opposed to the kind of depression you get when something bad  happens). This is a completely reasonable set of findings which match my intuition and the intuitions of most other psychiatrists.</p><p>But the past two decades of research have treated it poorly. The most  up-to-date and comprehensive meta-analysis of taxometric research I can  find is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nick_Haslam/publication/341912127_Dimensions_over_categories_a_meta-analysis_of_taxometric_research/links/5edee8c9a6fdcc476890a131/Dimensions-over-categories-a-meta-analysis-of-taxometric-research.pdf">Haslam, McGrath, and Kuppens from 2020</a>  . It strongly agrees with (my read of) Beauchaine that most psychiatric  conditions are dimensional like height or wealth. It is able to find  only hints of exceptions, nothing that it can confidently state is a  true category. But its list of exceptions is completely different from  Beauchaine&#8217;s, and much less sensible. It points to pedophilia,  addictions (including gambling addiction!), autism, and intermittent  explosive disorder as the most likely candidates for taxonicity (their  fancy word for being a true categorical distinction like species or  flu).</p><p>I&#8217;ll grant them pedophilia &#8211; it really does seem like people either  are or aren&#8217;t pedophiles and there&#8217;s something weird and specific going  on there.</p><p>Addictions (they specifically name alcoholism, nicotine addiction,  and pathological gambling) are more surprising &#8211; doesn&#8217;t alcoholism  progress pretty gradually from teetotalers to social drinkers to heavy  drinkers to raging alcoholics? Doesn&#8217;t smoking go from the occasional  smoker to pack-a-day smokers to extremely heavy smokers? I haven&#8217;t  hunted down all their individual studies, but I suspect this is a sort  of artifact of how people respond to their addictions. For example,  people who have lots of problems with tobacco either successfully quit  and become nonsmokers, or don&#8217;t quit and become heavy smokers. So there  might be an artificial divide where the only people who smoke are the  people who do it socially and enjoy it and feel no reason to quit, and  the people who are so addicted they can&#8217;t possibly quit.</p><p>Autism is such an annoying thing to have on this list &#8211; just when  everyone finally agreed there was an &#8220;autism spectrum&#8221; and no clear  difference between neurotypical-people-with-some-autistic-traits and  high-functioning-autistics, along comes this meta-analysis to say nope,  it&#8217;s a taxon, neurotypicals and autistics are two clear objectively  separate categories. I <em>did</em> hunt down the studies here and they  actually seemed pretty good. But none of these results are strong enough  to be more than suggestive, so I am going to keep believing in an  autism spectrum until more research comes in.</p><p>And intermittent explosive disorder! This is the fake disorder we  made up so that we had something to diagnose angry people with! I don&#8217;t  think anyone thought this one was real, not even the psychiatrists who  invented it and stuck it in the DSM! But here come the taxometricians,  saying that schizophrenia and bipolar and whatever are mere dimensional  variation, but IED (yes, that&#8217;s really the acronym) is an  honest-to-goodness crisply-defined category based on objective reality?  What gives?</p><p>And look what isn&#8217;t on here &#8211; schizophrenia, which is just a really  obvious separate taxon. You know, the condition where sometimes between  ages 18 and 25 for men and ages 25 to 35 or so for women, over the  course of a few weeks, seemingly normal people start getting extreme  hallucinations and eventually devolve into a state where they often  can&#8217;t live a normal life or even speak meaningful sentences? The  taxometricians are saying ah, whatever, it happens to all of us, they&#8217;re  just the people who it happens to more than average? Is that really  what they&#8217;re saying? I think they may have bungled this one, maybe by  over-focusing on studies of negative symptoms, or of psychosis more  generally, but I haven&#8217;t looked into it enough to be sure.</p><p>Overall this is just a really enraging meta-analysis, and even though  their methods look good and they did a lot of work to double-check  their results, I have trouble trusting them. To their credit, they are  pretty careful about what claims they make, and only say that the data  is <em>suggestive</em> of most of their categoricity claims. </p><p>Maybe instead of focusing on these few tenuous exceptions, we should  focus on the headline result: 75% of findings were &#8220;unambiguously  non-taxonic&#8221;, 17% were &#8220;unambiguously taxonic&#8221;, and 8% were &#8220;ambiguous&#8221;.  In other words, the field as a whole pretty strongly suggests that most  psychiatric disorders are just the tail end of normal variation, like  &#8220;tall person&#8221; or &#8220;rich person&#8221;, and not a separate category like  &#8220;rabbit&#8221; or &#8220;has the flu&#8221;. Among the conditions that were very strongly  found to be dimensional only were depression, anxiety, and ADHD.</p><p>In more depth:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-469-739" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dcfef80-040b-4a84-a414-21cc9554ab0c_739x469.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dcfef80-040b-4a84-a414-21cc9554ab0c_739x469.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7dcfef80-040b-4a84-a414-21cc9554ab0c_739x469.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:469,&quot;width&quot;:739,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

CCFI below 0.5 suggests dimensional variation  like height or wealth; above 0.5 suggests true categories like species  or having-the-flu. This plot is using much broader categories than the  individual conditions I mentioned before, but we can see that eating  disorders (like anorexia), childhood disorders (like autism), substance  use (like alcoholism), and a bunch of grab bag categories (including  things like dementia) are most likely to look taxonic.</p><p>A few other things stand out here. Just for fun, the authors included  some normal personality traits and psychological variables, like  &#8220;religious fundamentalism&#8221; and &#8220;interest in science&#8221;. I <em>think</em>  (though they don&#8217;t say so explicitly) that Big Five traits like  extraversion and so on are also in there. They predictably find low CCFI  for these, meaning they&#8217;re just dimensional normal variation. These are  honestly around the same CCFI as anxiety and mood disorders, meaning  that &#8220;depression&#8221; behaves in as trait-like a way as &#8220;interest in  science&#8221;, and vice versa. If you weren&#8217;t planning on coming up with some  separate category of &#8220;science-lovers&#8221; and demanding everyone classify  themselves as in it or out of it, you probably shouldn&#8217;t do the same  with depression.</p><p>They also have a category called &#8220;gender&#8221;. They say they included  measures like &#8220;femininity&#8221; and &#8220;sex-stereotyped activities&#8221; in there &#8211; I  can&#8217;t find more specifics. It has a CCFI of 0.42 with confidence  interval including 0.5, so looks slightly more dimensional, but can&#8217;t  quite rule out it being slightly more categorical. If anyone ever  demands you have an opinion on the question &#8220;is binary gender real?&#8221;, I  think the most scientifically-supported answer would be &#8220;it has a  Comparative Curve Fit Index of 0.42 plus or minus 0.1, which means it  trends towards dimensionality but taxonicity cannot be ruled out&#8221;.  There&#8217;s also a &#8220;sexuality&#8221; category on here, but it&#8217;s such a grab bag of  different things (sexual orientation, how promiscuous you are, etc)  that I&#8217;m not sure you can get much out of it; look at the individual  studies if you want to know more.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>Does this mean that, contra all those public awareness campaigns, &#8220;depression is just normal sadness&#8221; or whatever?</p><p>I&#8217;m not sure clinical depression is even kind of the same sort of thing as sadness. Lots of aspects of depression - like its tendency to occur in episodes lasting on average six months to a year - don&#8217;t seem like jacked-up aspects of normal sadness. So maybe this a bad example. But we can probably come up with equally awkward questions about other conditions. Is Generalized Anxiety Disorder just normal anxiety? Is ADHD just normal absent-mindedness?</p><p>Not necessarily <em>normal</em>. As the old saying goes, quantity has a quality all its own. Just because something is on a continuum with something else, doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be close to it.</p><p>Suppose you make the US median income of $36,000/year. You live in an average American town where you see people of various social strata. Your doctor makes $200,000/year and drives a Tesla. Your sister is a single mother making $20,000/year, and needs food stamps to make ends meet. You probably think you have a good sense of class distinctions.</p><p>What about Jeff Bezos? Is Bezos&#8217; fortune &#8220;just normal wealth&#8221;? </p><p>Taxometrically: yes. Jeff Bezos falls on the same continuum as everyone else. You can add one dollar to your own net worth, and keep doing that, and eventually end up at Jeff Bezos&#8217; net worth. At every point in between - a few hundred thousand, a few million, a few tens of millions - there will be some people at that point. There&#8217;s no clear distinction into two disjoint groups, where you&#8217;re in one and Jeff Bezos is in the other.</p><p>Practically: no. <em>Practically</em>, Jeff Bezos might as well be a different species. If your idea of wealth is a doctor who makes $200,000 a year, you&#8217;re totally unprepared to think about Jeff Bezos. Your whole economic world between the poor single mother and the rich doctor occupies one order of magnitude; Jeff Bezos is five orders of magnitude beyond it.</p><p>In <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/19/book-review-the-black-swan/">Nassim Taleb&#8217;s language</a>, Jeff Bezos lives in Extremistan. If you&#8217;re expecting a normal distribution, Bezos is way outside of it and looks like a different species. But really he&#8217;s just at the tail end of a distribution with much longer tails than you expected.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-333-1062" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a6174e0-3a42-45f1-9678-46c190d1a0b4_1062x333.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a6174e0-3a42-45f1-9678-46c190d1a0b4_1062x333.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1a6174e0-3a42-45f1-9678-46c190d1a0b4_1062x333.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:333,&quot;width&quot;:1062,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:10874,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

They&#8217;re the same sort of thing on the same distribution. But one is so much further out than our normal vocabulary for talking about these kinds of differences that it's okay to have a different word for it and different intuitions around it.</p><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>If most mental disorders are dimensional variation rather than taxa, that kind of makes the DSM look pretty silly, doesn&#8217;t it?</p><p>Remember, the DSM is fundamentally a diagnostic guide. It&#8217;s a list of  criteria to determine who has eg depression. To oversimplify just a  little, if a patient has five or more of their depression criteria, then  they &#8220;really have&#8221; depression, and a psychiatrist should diagnose them.  If they only meet four or fewer, they don&#8217;t have depression, and should  not get the diagnosis. All of this is predicated on the idea that  there&#8217;s a specific thing called depression that you either do or don&#8217;t  have.</p><p>Dimensional variation doesn&#8217;t work that way. Let&#8217;s return to our wealth analogy. Imagine a manual which let you diagnose someone as &#8220;rich&#8221; only if they  meet at least three of the following criteria:</p><p>1. Owns five or more cars<br> 2. Has a house in a gated community<br> 3. Has an income of $1,000,000 a year or above<br> 4. Takes first-class flights at least three times a year<br> 5. Engages in rich-person activities (horseback-riding, golfing, reading the New Yorker) at least twice a month</p><p>&#8230;and then every few years economists get into huge fights about whether maybe we should change this and say you have to own <em>six</em>  or more cars, or whether there should be an exemption for people who  own fewer cars but do have a private jet, and they all take it really  really seriously.</p><p>The problem isn&#8217;t that the criteria are wrong. All of these are  perfectly reasonable characteristics to correlate with richness. The  problem is that your project of dividing the world into &#8220;rich&#8221; and &#8220;not  rich&#8221; is fundamentally not a scientific one, and is more likely to  confuse than to enlighten. Someone with an income of $999,999 isn&#8217;t  interestingly different from someone with an income of $1,000,001;  owning four cars blends seamlessly into owning five.</p><p>This isn&#8217;t to say you never want to do something like this. Suppose  Bernie Sanders wants to increase taxes on the rich, but not on everyone  else. He needs some regulation about who the increased taxes hit, and  maybe something like this checklist (or more realistically just the  income cutoff at $1,000,000) is the way to go. It&#8217;s fine if he wants to  set something up like that &#8211; as long as economists don&#8217;t look at his  division of people into two bins and mistake it for the discovery of an  underlying cosmic secret that there are two types of people, rich and  non-rich, separated by the $1,000,000-a-year mark. </p><p>Are psychiatrists mistaking moderately useful bins for underlying  cosmic secrets? It&#8217;s hard for me to tell exactly how many people make  this mistake; the people who understand what&#8217;s going on and are just  using the categories as rules-of-thumb tend to sound a lot like the  people who don&#8217;t. My guess is most professionals, and an overwhelming  majority of laymen, are actually confused on this point, and this  messes them up in a lot of ways.</p><p>An economist or sociologist looking for the causes of wealth or  poverty understands that they&#8217;re doing a pretty complicated thing. In  the complex system that is human economic behavior, they will  probably find that all sorts of factors like upbringing, education,  genetics, health, discrimination, and luck interact to determine how  much money you have. On the other hand, a microbiologist looking for the  cause of the flu will be hoping to find a single specific thing &#8211; one  virus that all flu patients have and all healthy people don&#8217;t. I think a  lot of people still want psychiatry to deliver the single specific thing. It&#8217;s not going to be able to do that. If you hold out hope,  you&#8217;ll either end up overmedicalizing everything, or you&#8217;ll get disillusioned and radicalized and start saying all psychiatry is fake. I  think either would be a mistake.</p><p>In my practice, I&#8217;ve moved away from asking questions like &#8220;does this  patient really have ADHD&#8221;? Those kinds of questions make me feel like  I&#8217;m trying to decode their symptoms to uncover some secret variable that  could be either 0 or 1. But there is no such variable. Instead, I ask  &#8220;how much trouble does this person have with paying attention?&#8221;. This is  usually pretty easy to figure out; the patient will just tell me if I  ask!</p><p>Likewise, I&#8217;ve moved away from thought processes like &#8220;If this person  has ADHD, they genuinely need a stimulant; if not, they&#8217;re just  faking&#8221;. Instead, I try to think of how much the patient&#8217;s symptoms are  disabling them, whether a stimulant would relieve some of those  symptoms, how likely the symptoms are to go away without an stimulant,  and, based on all this, whether the benefits of a stimulant outweigh the  risks.</p><p>(this has another implication: stimulants shouldn&#8217;t be thought of as  magic bullets that &#8220;cure&#8221; &#8220;ADHD&#8221; by fixing the underlying cause, in the  same way that Tamiflu cures the flu by blocking flu viruses. They should  be thought of as things that affect the underlying stew of variables  that cause ADHD in some helpful way. By comparison, giving someone a  college scholarship might help them become richer, but it&#8217;s not &#8220;curing&#8221;  &#8220;the&#8221; &#8220;cause&#8221; of &#8220;poverty&#8221; in a way that flips them from a &#8220;not rich&#8221;  to a &#8220;rich&#8221; status.)</p><p>Also, this is why I don&#8217;t like the pressure to use  person-centered-language (eg instead of &#8220;autistic person&#8221;, you should  say &#8220;person with autism&#8221;). This sends exactly the wrong signal. If  autism is dimensional, we should think of it the same way we do height  and wealth &#8211; and we say &#8220;tall person&#8221; and &#8220;rich person&#8221;. Saying &#8220;person  with Height&#8221; or &#8220;Person with Richness&#8221; is strongly suggestive of &#8220;person  with the flu&#8221; &#8211; it implies a binary class that you either fall into, or  don&#8217;t. But that&#8217;s the opposite of what most research suggests, and the  opposite of the thought process that will help you think about these  conditions sensibly.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
